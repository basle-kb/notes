Goals: Write Commissioning Address
---------------------
- If it would be helpful, I am available to ghostwrite the article (or the draft/skeleton/parts of it).
- I could base it off of Dr. Husband’s notes on:
- - Christian response to COVID-19, particularly for universities, or
- - Seeking peace and wellbeing of the city (during COVID), or
- - Christian response to race relations (during COVID)
- For your reference, here is the original pitch:
- “When it comes to COVID-19, health offices around the world chart infections and deaths. __I wonder, however, if the greater impact of COVID-19 upon our society is not death but vulnerability__. In the face of such dramatic social and economic change, many, I suspect — in the depth of their hearts — are asking “why?”
    - Why has my life changed so very much?
    - Why am I cut off from my friends?
    - Why have I lost so very much,
    - Why am I not permitted to gather with all whom I love? And
    - why, am I lonely?
- These are all challenging questions. And when a vaccine remains no more than a distant hope on the horizon, these questions, I suspect, only grow in intensity.”
