__Make the most of shortcuts
You can find many shortcuts in the help menu in the bottom right corner of Roam. It may feel unnatural at first if you’re not someone who tends to use your keyboard a lot when using applications, but it’s definitely worth building the muscle memory to create a faster workflow.
CMD+B for bold, CMD+I for italic, CMD+H for highlights
CMD+ATL+1,2,3 (choose a number) to create H1, H2, or H3 titles
Use TAB to indent and SHIFT TAB to unindent
CMD+SHIFT+UP or CMD+SHIFT+DOWN to move the current block up or down
/ENTER to create a to-do checkbox 
CMD+SHIFT+D to go to your daily notes
CMD+U and start typing to activate the search bar (great to quickly access or create pages)
