- [[Welcome to New Staff]]
    - I. Welcome
    - II. At a Christian University you have the opportunity to experience and share in a different kind of work environment and community:
        - ^^Servant Leadership^^
        - "4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,
        - 5 so **in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.**
        - 6 **We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. **If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;
        - 7 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;
        - 8 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully." Romans 12:4-8
        - This passage reveals that as brothers and sisters in Christ, we have obligation to treat each other with profound respect. 
            - each of us have been given gifts by God
            - while each of us has been given __different gifts__, this passage reveals that each of our gifts are important and should be valued. 
    - III. Peter Drucker, writes, "Culture eats Strategy for the Better"
        - Breaking down silos. 
an opportunity to work hard, in the service of vital goals, without needing to get the credit. 
    - IV. What is Unique about a Christian University?
        - A. Creative and Redemptive Community
            - we owe students a very different vision of life and flourishing:
                - how can they use their gifts to glorify God and make a difference in the world. 
                    - In a chapter titled, "Joining our Work with God's Work, Ream and Glazer say the following: 
                        - "The Christian University must set before students **a grand vision of the Christian narrative that encompasses all of life**. For if students are shuffled into career or professional placement counseling that mimics the same language and operates from the same paradigm as secular universities, the Christian university has failed...**A creative and redemptive Christian university must be different**."
                        - It is this approach  to education that i am seeking to encourage here at Trinity.
