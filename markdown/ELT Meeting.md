    - Agenda:
        - Present: Aklilu, Bob, Brian, Mark, Phil, Richard, Sonya
        - 
        - Devotions – Richard (next week Richard)
        - 1. Institutional Program Prioritization Task Force Mandate - Mark
            - Current State of Preparation for IPP — Bob , Aklilu
                - Question of “in confidence"
        - 2. Enrolment Update - Brian Kerr
            - Preliminary Census
                - losing some semester hours - some are moving to part time, but remain enrolled at TWU
                    - could be wrestling with handling the online element
                    - payment date last year was September 13
                - Enrolment seems to be holding quite well
                - Where did the dramatic rise in graduate enrolment (more than double last year)
                    - MBA, and MA Lead (Business stream)
                        - not exclusively but largely 96 hour marathon
                            - problem with MA Lead - we are dependent upon one faculty member
                                - not sustainable in being able to keep or increase volume
                    - Enrolment Pipeline:
                        - barrier was flight and getting to Canada
                        - a huge market in Grad programs
                            - American students, International Students, and U.S. is not a great option
                        - Problem: we simply don’t have enough grad programs that meet the need of these students:
                            - “Business” is an attractive term
                            - Data Science, M.Tech (institutional Systems, and Analytics), M. Science and Management (Indiana Wesleyian)
                - Spring: hypothesis - incoming students don’t pick spring courses until they are already here — so we do not have as many students registered yet, as we work on a slower pace of registration intentionally.
                    - We implemented Web-registration this week — and we do this in one week: yet to come.
        - 3. Update on Revised Budget Process — Aklilu
            - Tuition revenue 3.5 million under last year’s budget
                - UG is lower than original budget by 2%, Grad is 14% higher than original budget
                - projecting January enrolment at 85% of fall numbers (rather than 95%)
                - 3.8% lower than original budget
                - EBIDT is significantly below last year. 
                - Macro number: amount that is replaced by Spring enrolment (how much of the sales in the Fall is replaced by the Spring) - what replacement number do we need in January in GLOBAL?
                    - 1. compensation increases go up, even though we have made adjustments
                        - costs of the people hired in 19-20 fiscal year, faculty who were hired in and staff who were hired in 19-20, but not added on May 1, they get fully reflected in 20-21.
                    - 2. debt servicing costs
                        - Amount of money that we need to have available in order to cover friendly RRSP debt, and the amount that we set aside to carry the credit line with HSBC
            - Drop/Add date: 
            - Projections (likely end)
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2Fnlo8Z79NBh.png?alt=media&token=ca276a44-47c9-4f12-bcab-2ad15bd69274)
        - 4. Discussion: physical space utilization procedures at TWU — Aklilu
            - Pressures on space
                - no current procedure to ask for and acquire space
                - we need a policy to have this managed by campus services team:
                    - implementing priorities that: feedback necesary to Aklilu.
        - 5. Discussion: risk related to student parties – Sonya
            - We are at our biggest risk: student activity at parties
                - Athletics is starting to come down quickly
                    - are we moving policies to address this
            - Discussion
                - We need co-ordination of Athletics, Student-life, and Health Safety restrictions.
                    -
