    - Zoom Meeting - International Students
        - while the government turned down MLB and approved NHL opening, there are clearly challenges in ensuring a safe-arrival for students while enhancing our reputation for being able to manage the influx of new students. 
        - Progress:
            - enabling students to begin study online. 
        - If we have evidence of students being denied access, we ought to send information about this to Universities Canada as advocates for us -- they are building a file of data to help advocacy: contact: CMyintyre at Universities Canada -- Cindy
