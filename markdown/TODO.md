- {{{[[DONE]]}}}} respond to Spartan Foundation email
    - Hello Dr. Husbands, I trust things are going well during these different times and that you have had a chance to enjoy the summer a little? Attached is our draft agenda for our [[Wed. Sept. 2]] [[Spartan Foundation Board meeting ]]starting at 8:30am in the Northwest Building on campus. It will be in the NW 106 small conference room, some will zoom in and some will be there in person.
    - We usually have a guest staff/coach come at the beginning of our meeting to share (as you did last July), so we would like to give you the opportunity to share about this past year, from your perspective along with an informal Q&A.
    - We are looking forward to having you as the new TWU rep to our board. We ask that you prepare a report that we will post in our Sharepoint folder before the meeting for our boards review ahead of time. See below for suggested items to include in your report. Maybe Ann could send to Renee to post and prepare a few hard copies? We do give some time for you as the TWU rep to talk about the top issues, and we ask Jeff Gamache to give us an Athletics report as well.
