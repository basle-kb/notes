- Dear << Test First Name >>,
- I personally wish to invite you to participate in an important conversation about the development of a vision for Trinity Western University.
- As part of a larger initiative to cast a compelling and effective vision for the future of Trinity Western University, I recently had the privilege of engaging in conversation with over 250 people during a series of 15 virtual small group events titled, "Life Doesn't Come With A Map."
- In meeting with a wide array of representative groups and individuals from across the University and beyond, I was struck by the deep sense of appreciation and regard—dare I say, 'love'—for the mission of Trinity Western University, that was almost unilaterally expressed by all.
- The response to these limited engagement events was so positive that I began to wonder how we might effectively share this content with the larger TWU community, inviting more of our staff and faculty into this iterative process of developing a vision statement.
- To that end, I invite you to watch the video presentation below—my apologies for 'the talent' but I am trusting that the content will be worth your time and consideration—and for you to then offer feedback on what you've seen, as it relates to establishing the vision of TWU, by completing a short survey. The link to the survey can be found at the end of the presentation.
- Thank you again for taking the time to share in this journey with me. I greatly appreciate your time and contribution to this process, as I anticipate it will be quite valuable as we develop and launch a new vision for this vital global Christian University.
- Grace and peace,
