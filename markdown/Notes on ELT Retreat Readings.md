- Here is the list of topics with accompanying readings and "assignments to facilitate the discussion"
- ^^TOPIC, Readings, and Facilitator^^
    - 1. In order to prepare to introduce this reading, ask yourself the following question (before you start the reading): what did you think this topic/article was going to be about?
    - 2. After completing the reading, and as you prepare to introduce it, ask yourself “how has my mind changed as a result of today’s reading(s)?
    - 3. Identify what, in your opinion, is the most important passage from the assigned reading and be prepared to explain why this is the case.
    - 4. What two questions about this topic do you hope that we answer today – i.e., what are the most important questions left for you that you hope to better understand at the conclusion of our time together?
    - 5. How might this topic and reading enable ELT and TWU to make significant progress this year. In a season of disruption, we have the opportunity and need to reimagine all that we are doing to determine how best to (1) determine the "job that needs to be done" among our existing and prospective students; (2) realign key facets of what we have been doing to more successfully deliver a compelling value proposition.

    - ### Enrolment Challenges at Evangelical Institutions

            - 1. I thought that this piece would offer specific reasons for general enrolment challenges (tied to both COVID-19 and immanent national declines in US enrolment following 2025)
            - 2. We have been preparing for significant enrolment challenges for a decade in the U.S. -- changes seem to be now underway and COVID-19 has either accelerated or highlighted structural flaws (i.e., the challenge of being enrolment driven without the protection of a sufficient endowment to protect against an economic downturn).
            - 3. Here is my sense of the most important passage(s):

            - 4. What two questions about this topic do you hope that we answer today:
                - ^^Q.1. Is TWU, as a whole, fully alert to how vulnerable we are, or is the majority in denial/ignorance?^^

 – i.e., what are the most important questions left for you that you hope to better understand at the conclusion of our time together?
                    - ^^Q2. How might we build an awareness of our vulnerability without creating undue fear or uncertainty?^^
            - 5. How might this topic and reading enable ELT and TWU to make significant progress this year? 
                - **Q. What steps do you think that we -- as Administrators -- will need to do in order to be "extraordinarily strategic" (even while this is "still no guarantee of survival")?**

                - Addressing the challenges of Difference and Dissolution is not peripheral to the effective witness of the Church -- it requires a sophisticated commitment to developing "thoroughly Christian minds" -- when the __Scandal of the Evangelical Mind__ still remains. 
            - 3. Identify what, in your opinion, is the most important passage from the assigned reading and be prepared to explain why this is the case.
                - (p. 202 - bottom of page)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2FWPfOWdLnsk.png?alt=media&token=47683059-faf5-40eb-bcf8-5f18fe7392a0)
            - 4. What two questions about this topic do you hope that we answer today – i.e., what are the most important questions left for you that you hope to better understand at the conclusion of our time together?
                - ^^Q1. Is it not the case that the "price of admission" for calling yourself a Christian **Global** University is that you are willing to equip students to successfully and faithfully navigate a pluralistic world (i.e., difference)?^^
                - ^^Q2. Are we sufficiently invested in the task of "enveloping" (i.e., educating and supporting) students who come to TWU with the aspiration to believe (and develop strong and coherent beliefs)? Are we committed to excellence in the development / formation of "thoroughly Christian minds"? If not, why not, and what would it take to get there?^^
                - 
            - 5. How might this topic and reading enable ELT and TWU to make significant progress this year. 
                - ^^Do we have the leadership and financial resources to truly prepare students to thrive in a world of difference and dissolution?^^
