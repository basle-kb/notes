    - with [[Mike Williams]] [[Program Prioritization]]
        - Matthew 25 - Jesus' time with his apostles - preparing them for his departure and his return. 
            - Everything we have has been given to us by God. 
                - It is a temptation to see ourselves as owners rather than stewards
            - We are not all entrusted with the same things: to each according to his ability.
            - There is a day of reckoning: how do we steward what has been given to us -- judgement
        - I need not to presume on the grace of God -- that I approach each day with a reliance upon

    - **Methodology**
    - a focus on:
        - 1. Demand/External /Internal
            - anticipated major information and graduates
        - 2. Revenue Cost Margin
        - 80% of all majors graduated in 50% of all progams. 
    - biggest cost: salary and benefits
        - include overload pay in the total
        - apportion each instructor's salary based upon standard courses
        - including adjuncts and apportion costs on what they actually teach
    - The largest drive of margin is the number of students in a class
        - Key Drivers: cost per student credit hour: # of students, use of adjuncts, higher salary in a given major.
    - Benefits, and budget costs are all included. 
    - Four Basic Patterns: comparing Demand, Cost, Yield
    - Questions: can you explain that the "yield rate" indicates?
    - Contribution margin - selling price minus institutional cost
- **Athletics: requests for hiring**
    - full time job requests
    - complicated
        - strategically -- agreed to adding JV teams at a lower cost (focused on net return on margin), but did not look at the overall margin of athletics
            - athletics is costing us more than the gross tuition by student athletes
        - through COVID-19 : meeting with coaches
            - sense: the right thing to approve these positions, but will need to reconsider the entire athletics programs
        - Q. what happens to athletes if we can't have face to face 
        - Q. Should H.R. be looking at contracts that have a hiring condition for these athletic contracts. 


Value Proposition: U sports is in trouble
            - they add value only when they can compete.
