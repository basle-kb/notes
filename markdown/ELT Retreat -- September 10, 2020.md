- ## ^^How to Prepare for your Assigned Reading(s)^^
    - In order to facilitate a good discussion of the assigned reading(s), strive to organize your thoughts and reflections in light of the following: 
        - Carefully read the chapter or article that has been assigned to you. 
        - For each reading assigned to you, take the time to identify the most important passages, and arrive at the discussion with two or three questions that the material has raised for you.
    - Note, if you have been assigned the task of introducing one of the assigned readings for the day, take the time to write a concise introduction to the reading that covers the following:
        - 1. In order to prepare to introduce this reading, ask yourself the following question (before you start the reading): what did you think this topic/article was going to be about?
        - 2. After completing the reading, and as you prepare to introduce it, ask yourself “how has my mind changed as a result of today’s reading(s)?
        - 3. Identify what, in your opinion, is the most important passage from the assigned reading and be prepared to explain why this is the case.
        - 4. What two questions about this topic do you hope that we answer today – i.e., what are the most important questions left for you that you hope to better understand at the conclusion of our time together?
        - 5. How might this topic and reading enable ELT and TWU to make significant progress this year. In a season of disruption, we have the opportunity and need to reimagine all that we are doing to determine how best to (1) determine the "job that needs to be done" among our existing and prospective students; (2) realign key facets of what we have been doing to more successfully deliver a compelling value proposition. 
    - __Note: you will have about 5 minutes to introduce the assigned reading.__
