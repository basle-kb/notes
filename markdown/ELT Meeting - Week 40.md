    - Baylor University
        - Undergraduate pathway - Engineering
            - direct pathway with pre-engineering 2 years at TWU, 2 more years at Baylor.
        - Graduate pathway
        - International students at Baylor are in a bit of a dead-end
            - Baylor has indicated that none of their graduating undergraduates are able to remain in the U.S.
            - We could pair M.A. Lead general stream with Masters of Science and Data Analytics
                - we would have an articulation agreement with Baylor
                    - courses are shared from both Master's Degree
