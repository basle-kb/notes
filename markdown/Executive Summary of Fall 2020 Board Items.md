- BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION & FINANCES
    - Under the direction of Aklilu Mulat (Senior Vice President of
Business Administration and CFO), have done an exemplary job of responding to the challenge of COVID-19 with with discipline, care, and efficacy. The negative financial impacts of COVID-19 would have been significant had Aklilu and his team failed to navigate these challenges as effectively as they have.
    - Financial Services engaged in a number of initiatives of which the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) primary. This has resulted in a subsidy of $4.9 mil for the period of April – June.  
    - Financial Services pivoted quickly to provide remote processing 
    - IT has been central in the development of new multi-access technology, implementation of VPN service for international students, improving the single-sign system for students, campus connectivity between Langley and Richmond, improved cellular signal at the Minoru campus, improved service management systems, improved access of student photos for teaching and learning, and full deployment of Microsoft Teams for teaching and learning.
    - TWU Ancillaries consisting of housing, dining, conferencing and TW Outfitters (bookstore) have been severely affected by the pandemic. Summer conferencing revenue, which was budgeted to be $860K was reduced to $9K due to cancellations. We are budgeting a revenue reduction of 50% from the originally budgeted amount for dining and housing due to the restricted residency capacity.
    - Preparations for fall return of students included extensive work by maintenance and custodial staff.  In particular, preparation and organization for quarantined students was managed well. Significant lighting upgrades have been made throughout campus improving accessibility and safety while reducing costs related to utilities. The team has implemented Pay-by-Phone parking, installed a fire alarm system at Mattson Centre, negotiated with Translink to bring bus service to campus, built a bus stop and improved and built several sidewalks.  In addition, the team has completed fire alarm upgrades in Fraser Hall, library basement renovations, Music Building upgrades and Trinity Commons renovation. 
    - The efforts of the Business Administration team have been focused
on enabling TWU departments to accomplish their respective goals in the midst of disruption due to COVID-19.  To this end, staff members have demonstrated both understanding and commitment to the university’s mission.

- DEVELOPMENT
    - Our ability to continue to serve our growing student body depends upon our ability to sustain and nurture new partnerships
with donors. In the absence of an effective leader in the area of Development, the President has addressed the lack of clear strategy and accountability by:
    - (1) developing and implementing a new Donor Cultivation and Recognition Process; 
    - (2) launched a national search for a new Vice President of
Development; while 
    - (3) transitioning an existing V.P. of Development to a new
position: V.P. of Philanthropy (Principal Gifts). 
    - Key to the future success of the Development office will be the acquisition of a V.P. of Development with exceptional communication, leadership, and management skills, and an ability to negotiate across a diversity of cultures, and high emotional intelligence, with a proven track record of innovative and strategic fundraising efforts.

- ENROLMENT
    - In March, during the peak of the recruitment cycle, the planet
went into lockdown. Our ability to meet with families, visit high schools, run
Preview events, as well as most every other recruitment activity abruptly
ended. Current students were sent home and classes moved online, not affording
us the benefit of properly bringing the semester to a close before students
scattered around the world. For many families, the financial reality of
COVID-19 began to set in and we started to receive requests for re-evaluations
of financial aid packages and inquiries about deferral of studies. It was clear
that the March-September enrolment season would be unlike any other. To be
successful, we would need to focus on 3 key elements: __recruitment, retention, __and__ access__.
    - As our Enrolment and TWU GLOBAL teams continued to focus on recruitment, a team of 50+ staff and faculty from most every department on campus came together to focus on retention. For the first time, incoming and current students were served within one CRM platform, allowing for access to data from a variety of a departments to be brought together for the collective task of retention. While enrolment was being secured by recruitment and retention efforts, 12 interdepartmental task forces worked to create TWU Access, allowing students to access the TWU experience from anywhere in the world.
    - Because the Trinity Western community came together to focus
on recruitment, retention, and access, we were able to welcome the largest student body in the history of TWU. Fall 2020 enrolment is 4,774 students, up from 4,476 in 2019. Overall university enrolment has increased 6.7% over last year.
    - In the wake of the departure of Scott Fehrenbacher, I have promoted (1) Brian Kerr to Senior Vice President of Enrolment, Personal and Career Development, and (2) Dr. Phil Laird, to the position of Chief Innovation Officer, Vice Provost of Global. Trinity Western University is blessed to have these remarkably talented individuals. Brian and Phil possess a truly exceptional depth of expertise, knowledge, social intelligence, and commitment to the mission of Trinity Western University.
    - Recruitment for 2021 cohorts has begun, albeit in a very different way than last year. Almost every element of recruitment has changed. Typically, at this time year, each member of our recruitment team is on the road. They would often visit 3 high schools per day, take part in large college fairs, meet in-person with a prospective student and their parents, and host countless visitors on-campus for tours and appointments.  __This year__, high schools are closed to outside visitors, college fairs are virtual, and in-person campus visits must be done with strict COVID-19 protocols in place.
    - In order to meet the challenges of this rapidly evolving landscape, we have restructured our Enrolment Management Department. The timing, pace, and virtual nature of events will require a more agile and adaptable team.
    - In September 2020, as the former External Relations division was reorganized, a new collection of departments was brought together. Under the umbrella of Enrolment, Personal & Career Development (EPCD), the existing Enrolment Management team is now connected to Parent Engagement and TWU Alumni. Over the coming year, the Office of Personal and Career Development will be added into the mix, allowing for a fully-integrated focus on the student journey. 
    - Although still in the design phase, the creation of the Office of Personal & Career Development represents one of the greatest opportunities that TWU has to increase value proposition and to advance its mission and vision. There is no doubt that Trinity Western’s mission is vital to the wellbeing of Canada and the world.  Each year, hundreds of graduates earn degrees from TWU. While many students navigate this journey well, gaining the skills and convictions that we hoped for them, some fall short of realizing the true potential of a Trinity Western education. As the nature of the student body continues to grow in diversity, in terms of cultures, campus locations, ages of students, and level of study, it is critical that we ensure a coordinated effort as we prepare students to live out the mission of Trinity Western University.

- HEALTH & SAFETY
    - __But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. Isaiah 40:31a__
    - The remarkable Chair of the 23-member COVID-19 Health & Safety Task Force, Dr. Sonya Grypma, worked shoulder-to-shoulder with exceptionally gifted and committed colleagues, who together helped to develop the comprehensive [**TWU COVID-19 Safety Plan**](https://www.twu.ca/sites/default/files/public_covid-19_health_safety_plan_aug2020.pdf) published in August 2020.
    - On May 7, 2020, the day after the BC Restart Plan was published, we launched a series of task forces to help prepare for Fall 2020. One of these was the Health & Safety Task Force. Building on work done since January 2020 by the TWU COVID-19 Response team, members of this task force met almost daily between May and August with the following mandate: “**To provide clear direction to TWU leaders regarding how to safely re-open and run TWU campuses in a way that reduces the spread of COVID-19.” **
    - We have transitioned our efforts from planning to operations, via the establishment of a COVID-19 Public Health Team. This team is comprised of a newly-hired Public Health Lead, Taryne Lepp, the Director of the Wellness Centre Michele Regehr, and a number of newly-hired public health nurses working for us on a contracted basis. Under the direction of Sonya Grypma as Senior Health Advisor, the Public Health Team aims to safely maximize all TWU in-person experiences. We have done this through the development of protocols and processes that have, to date, allowed for the safe return to campus of 650 residential students, and the provision of face-to-face courses for 10% of regular TWU courses (based on our current headcount of 5500 students, this involves approximately 550 students). In addition, we have developed processes and materials for COVID-19 communication, leader training, digital solutions for daily self-assessment and campus logins, and a sophisticated approval process for all in-person programs, activities, and events.
    - TWU is well prepared to safely support our students, faculty, and staff through this global pandemic. In addition to the above, we are well prepared to support testing, contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine as necessary. Although we anticipate and are prepared for COVID transmission within our TWU population, we are grateful to the Lord that, to date, we have had no COVID-19 positive student cases.
