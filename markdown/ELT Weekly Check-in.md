[[Sonya Grypma]] - COVID-19 Plan 
    An external facing document: an expectation that we have this
        hope to have this distributed this week. 
        examine it and offer Sonya immediate feedback
    I might need to review the President's portion. 
    N.B. we still have not clearly identified who will offer regular updates for students:
        do we have a training for students (but we have no indication of how that will be operationalized.)
            a short educational piece. 
**Feedback on the Document to Finance Committee**
    Question: budget process
        Need first of all to assess how we are going to project revenue for the period September to April (next week)
            These projections will provide a baseline for our expectations and to pre-build the expenditures based on the lower of last year's actual or budgeted.
