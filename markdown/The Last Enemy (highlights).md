    - “Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will all be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: ‘Death has been swallowed up in victory.’”1 Corinthians 15:51–54 
    - The Scriptures, the Old Testament and the New, are clear that God stands against death. God “will swallow up death forever” (Isa. 25:8). “I will deliver this people from the power of the grave,” God declares, “I will redeem them from death” (Hosea 13:14). Men and women are resurrected in both testaments. Jesus grieved death—and overcame it. The victory of God is the defeat of death.

We trust that we will be united with God when we depart this earthly life because we believe in his promises. This is the purpose of our being, and the promise of our redemption. And when we are united with God, we trust we will be restored into fellowship with our loved ones who are also united with him.
