    - E: Speaking Request – Fosmark Groundbreaking Ceremony
        - Bill Taylor has invited you to participate in their short ground breaking ceremony on Wednesday of next week.
            - 1.      He said they would have you hold a shovel with them (sod-turning), and
            - 2.      Say a few words to the Free Church family (they will be filming).  When I asked for specifics he said, he would like you to tell them why it is good for the EFCC to be staying on campus. (FYI – if you agree to this, it would be put right in front of the groundbreaking part on the schedule attached).
