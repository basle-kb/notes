    - 1. Discussion of the results of the [[ELT Typeform Survey -- October 14, 2020]] https://markhusbands186063.typeform.com/to/UqMZhbQ6
        - Note: 
            - the sample size is small
            - I did not give you much context
                - I also did not direct you to answer the question in a way that you thought perhaps I would want you to answer or to answer in a way that is utterly true. 
                    - For the record, I prefer "utterly true" and when we work together as ELT I am not generally asking for marketing language or postures so you might want to clarify your answer if it shows up on the screen. 
                - It is also worth asking: what does the range of response and perhaps even misunderstanding of certain things reveal about us.
