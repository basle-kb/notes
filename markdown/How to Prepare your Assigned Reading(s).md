- In order to facilitate a good discussion of the assigned reading(s), strive to organize your thoughts and reflections in light of the following: 
    - Carefully read and re-read the chapter or article that has been assigned to you. 
    - For each reading assigned to you, take the time to identify:
        - the most important passages, and arrive at the discussion with two or three questions that the material has raised for you.
- Note, if you have been assigned the task of introducing one of the assigned readings for the day, take the time to write a concise introduction to the reading that covers the following:
    - 1. In order to prepare to introduce this reading, ask yourself the following question (before you start the reading): what did you think this doctrine / topic was going to be about?
    - 2. After completing the reading, and as you prepare to introduce it, ask yourself “how has my mind changed as a result of today’s reading(s)?
    - 3. Identify what, in your opinion, is the most important passage from the assigned reading and be prepared to explain why this is the case.
    - 4. What two questions about this topic do you hope that we answer today – i.e., what are the most important questions left for you that you hope to better understand at the conclusion of our time together?
    - 5. How might this topic intersect with facets of your professional work/discipline? Is there a distinctive Christian claim in the reading or discussion that you believe secular counterparts in your discipline would question or perhaps reject? If so, what exactly is this point of difference and why do you think it exists?
- Note: you will have no more than 4 minutes to introduce the assigned reading.
