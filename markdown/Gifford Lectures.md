- [[Michael Welker]] "In God's Image"
Date: 2019University of Edinburgh
Place: From the University of Edinburgh
- Outline: This lecture series explores the concept ‘in God's image’. Human existence, ranging ‘from dust to dust’ to ‘only a little lower than God’, challenges us to discern the moral, scientific, technological, and religious powers that human beings bring to bear most effectively within this broad spectrum. An examination at an intellectual level and beyond illuminates the emergence of the human potential for justice, freedom, truth, and peace.
