        - "What were these positive aspects [of Christian learning produced by Christendom]? They would include the broad perspective on life. We mentioned earlier the great passage from Colossians 1 about all things "holding together in Christ" (cf. Col 1:17). At its best, the Christendom ideal argued, or took for granted, that everything held together in Christ. At its best, it was able to see why natural learning, natural resources, governmental resources were properly devoted to understanding more about the Gospel, understanding more about God's creative actions in the world. At its best, Christendom had a sense of history, whereby the best fruits of previous generations continued to be harvested long after those who'd planted the plants that gave forth the fruit had passed from the scene. At its best, Christendom realized the practical benefits of a body metaphor for the Church. Yes, some members of the body would be diligent and consuming themselves in explicitly religious tasks, but other parts of the body, because of the breadth of divine creation, and the possibilities of divine salvation, would be naturally working on what we would call secular tasks, but all for the glory of God."
