>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. -- Matthew 6:33 (ESV)

**Mission Statement**
    "The mission of Trinity Western University, as an arm of the Church, is to develop godly Christian leaders: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

    Note: if you look carefully at the syntax or grammatical structure of this sentence you notice, a clause and a colon.
    "^^The mission of Trinity Western University^^, as an arm of the Church, ^^is to develop godly Christian leaders^^: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

        In a sense, the actual mission of TWU is ^^to develop godly Christian leaders^^.
            everything else serves to develop what we mean by "godly Christian leaders".
*What -- How -- Why?
    What: our current mission states **what** Trinity Western University does.
        **What does Trinity Western University do?**
        Answer: ^^develop godly Christian leaders^^.
        Others may question or seek to replace this mission with something else -- in order to shift the strategic direction of the university to pursue some other goal, but **this** is what we have committed ourselves to do. **Developing godly Christian leaders is why Trinity Western University exists**.
        It does not adequately express **why** we do this.
    However, there are two related questions that follow from this observation?
        ^^What will happen in the world if we are successful in carrying out this mission?^^ and
        ^^How will the world be better because Trinity Western University was faithful in carrying out its distinctly Christian calling and mission as a global Christian University?^^
