    - America’s Christian colleges promise students not just an education but moral and spiritual enlightenment. The coming fall semester presents a new moral quandary: Can a reopening that poses serious health risks be justified in the eyes of God? Does the decision to hold in-person classes represent a brave step forward — or a reckless turn away from honoring the sanctity of life? 
    - Kevin Timpe, a professor of Christian philosophy at Calvin University, in Michigan, said public health is clearly a moral issue that should concern all colleges.

We’re called to care specifically for the disadvantaged, the vulnerable, the marginalized. 
    - “But I also think the Church, especially, has reason to care about how the pandemic disproportionately affects some parts of our communities more than others,” Timpe wrote in an email to The Chronicle. “After all, we’re called to care specifically for the disadvantaged, the vulnerable, the marginalized. If we don’t take seriously our responsibilities to these groups, we fail to live up to our mission.” 
    - The King’s College, in New York City, cites in its compact Philippians 2:4: “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”
