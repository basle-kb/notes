- "I think it would be hard to come up with an issue that is of greater significance to the whole world actually than the issue of Leadership. The Christian leaders that demonstrate wisdom are the ones I want to hold up as exemplars. **Leadership is about Character in Action** (skills, abilities, talents, those things come in time)" -- Mark Labberton, President, __Fuller Theological Seminary__.
