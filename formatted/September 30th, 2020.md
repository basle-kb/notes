        - >"__Our hope is that this fundraising event brings people together, and we are encouraging viewing parties amongst friends. Please indicated below if you are open to hosting a small gathering in your home:"
        - I am thinking of something like this: 
"This event is a great opportunity for you to gather with family and friends who, like you, love Trinity Western and are eager to learn more about the way that God continues to bless and guide the university in the midst of COVID-19. 
Please indicate below if you are open to hosting a small gathering, dinner and "watch party" in your home."
        - Do you have a better sense of how to express this?
This is a great chance to gather with friends who love TWU and are eager to learn
