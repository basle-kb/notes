- Objective
    - __Summarize the immediate context this project lives in__
        - In the wake of COVID-19 all students are
  entering a TWU experience that is new to all of them—whether they are an
  incoming or returning student—and thus __all__
  students are in need of an orientation to the new TWU.
        -   In order to deliver this orientation to everyone regardless of location we
  are working to develop several videos that will help students understand the
  essense of TWU and how they will engage with community, courses and student
  services. One of those videos will be an introduction to or a welcome to TWU.
  This video will feature President Husbands introducing students to the
  origins, mission and vision of TWU.
- Goal
    - __Define what success looks like for this project__
        - The goal of these videos is to have
  students understand the essense of what TWU is like, why it exists, inspire
  them and reaffirm they have chosen the right school. This video will be
  foundational in the orientation/re-orientation process.
