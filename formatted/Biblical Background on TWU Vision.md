                - the latter is impoverished-- in which freedom of choice and public life is the ability to choose from a wealth of options. 
                    - We need a recovery of an older tradition of freedom in which "to be free is to share in sefl-rule, but to participate meaningfully in self-government requires institutions and social practices that cultivate in citizens certain qualities of character, certain habits and dispositions that orient us to the common good." 
            - A modern individualist tradition of freedom is impoverished. 
                - "The older civic understanding of human freedom is in tension with the idea of unfettered freedom of choice which is really a consumerist understanding of freedom."

- Notes on [Thoroughly Equipped for What?](https://mintools.com/blog/thoroughly-equipped-good-works.htm)
    - My notes: 
        - Importance of:
            - 2 Timothy 3:16-17
            - Hebrews 13:21
            - 2 Peter 1:3
            - 
    - The article:
        - [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Tim%203.16-17) teaches about:
            - [God’s intent to thoroughly equip](https://mintools.com/blog/thoroughly-equipped.htm) – furnished completely complete
            - [God’s means of equipping](https://mintools.com/blog/means-thoroughly-equipped.htm) – Scripture
            - [God’s intended recipients of such equipping](https://mintools.com/blog/who-thoroughly-equipped.htm) – all who belong to Him
        - Now we get to the final phrase which shows the purpose for which Scripture thoroughly equips us — “for every good work”.
        - ## Scripture is Enough to Equip Us for Every Good Work
        - Scripture contains all we need to equip us for whatever good work we might do. While we can learn from psychology and science, we must always run it through the grid of Scripture. But, if we only had the Bible, it would be enough. — “His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.” ([2 Pet. 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Pet.%201.3)) — Scripture provides knowledge about God. — “Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.” ([2 Pet. 1:4](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Pet.%201.4))
        - This is why the [Train Church Leaders Practicum](https://trainchurchleaders.com/practicum/) runs various tasks leaders do through the grid of God’s Word in regard to His purposes, design and mission for the Church, Christ-like character, power, etc. People from around the world can be equipped through this training since it seeks to be scripturally rather than culturally based.
        - ## The Kind of Work for Which Scripture Thoroughly Equips
        - The adjectives used in [2 Timothy 3:17](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Tim%203.17) describe the kind of work Scripture equips us to do.
        - 1) **Good** Work
        - What constitutes something good?
            - It’s fruitful effect: beneficial, useful
            - It’s excellent quality: meets a standard
            - It’s upright character: done with integrity, pleasing to God
        - God uses His Word to teach us what fits the above criteria. Any work we do which is purely selfish or carnal, will not be that which benefits others or pleases God. Don’t expect God to provide wisdom or strength for that which does not align with Him. Scripture equips us for “good” work.
        - 2) **Every** Good Work
        - No task falls outside of the scope of “every” good work. Scripture equips us for each and every individual good work we do of all types of good deeds. That means God will equip us, through His Word, for ministry that is …
            - behind-the-scenes or upfront
            - task-oriented or people-oriented
            - a big ministry assignment or a seemingly small one
            - full-time, part-time, or volunteer
        - ## The Ultimate Purpose in Being Thoroughly Equipped for Every Good Work
        - If we look at the whole of Scripture, we find the ultimate effect of Christians doing good. The more thoroughly equipped, the more we will bear fruit to the glory of God.
        - __In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. ([Matt. 5:6](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Matt.%205.6))__
        - __We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, ([Col. 1:9-10](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Col.%201.9-10))__
        - When we are thoroughly equipped for every good work, we grow in our relationship with God, others are helped, and most importantly, God is glorified.
