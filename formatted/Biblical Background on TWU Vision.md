                - the latter is impoverished-- in which freedom of choice and public life is the ability to choose from a wealth of options. 
                    - We need a recovery of an older tradition of freedom in which "to be free is to share in sefl-rule, but to participate meaningfully in self-government requires institutions and social practices that cultivate in citizens certain qualities of character, certain habits and dispositions that orient us to the common good." 
            - A modern individualist tradition of freedom is impoverished. 
                - "The older civic understanding of human freedom is in tension with the idea of unfettered freedom of choice which is really a consumerist understanding of freedom."

- Notes on [Thoroughly Equipped for What?](https://mintools.com/blog/thoroughly-equipped-good-works.htm)
    - My notes: 
        - Importance of:
            - 2 Timothy 3:16-17
            - Hebrews 13:21
            - 2 Peter 1:3
            - 
    - The article:
        - [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Tim%203.16-17) teaches about:
            - [God’s intent to thoroughly equip](https://mintools.com/blog/thoroughly-equipped.htm) – furnished completely complete
            - [God’s means of equipping](https://mintools.com/blog/means-thoroughly-equipped.htm) – Scripture
            - [God’s intended recipients of such equipping](https://mintools.com/blog/who-thoroughly-equipped.htm) – all who belong to Him
        - Now we get to the final phrase which shows the purpose for which Scripture thoroughly equips us — “for every good work”.
        - ## Scripture is Enough to Equip Us for Every Good Work
        - Scripture contains all we need to equip us for whatever good work we might do. While we can learn from psychology and science, we must always run it through the grid of Scripture. But, if we only had the Bible, it would be enough. — “His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.” ([2 Pet. 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Pet.%201.3)) — Scripture provides knowledge about God. — “Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.” ([2 Pet. 1:4](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Pet.%201.4))
        - This is why the [Train Church Leaders Practicum](https://trainchurchleaders.com/practicum/) runs various tasks leaders do through the grid of God’s Word in regard to His purposes, design and mission for the Church, Christ-like character, power, etc. People from around the world can be equipped through this training since it seeks to be scripturally rather than culturally based.
        - ## The Kind of Work for Which Scripture Thoroughly Equips
        - The adjectives used in [2 Timothy 3:17](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/2%20Tim%203.17) describe the kind of work Scripture equips us to do.
        - 1) **Good** Work
        - What constitutes something good?
            - It’s fruitful effect: beneficial, useful
            - It’s excellent quality: meets a standard
            - It’s upright character: done with integrity, pleasing to God
        - God uses His Word to teach us what fits the above criteria. Any work we do which is purely selfish or carnal, will not be that which benefits others or pleases God. Don’t expect God to provide wisdom or strength for that which does not align with Him. Scripture equips us for “good” work.
        - 2) **Every** Good Work
        - No task falls outside of the scope of “every” good work. Scripture equips us for each and every individual good work we do of all types of good deeds. That means God will equip us, through His Word, for ministry that is …
            - behind-the-scenes or upfront
            - task-oriented or people-oriented
            - a big ministry assignment or a seemingly small one
            - full-time, part-time, or volunteer
        - ## The Ultimate Purpose in Being Thoroughly Equipped for Every Good Work
        - If we look at the whole of Scripture, we find the ultimate effect of Christians doing good. The more thoroughly equipped, the more we will bear fruit to the glory of God.
        - __In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. ([Matt. 5:6](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Matt.%205.6))__
        - __We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, ([Col. 1:9-10](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Col.%201.9-10))__
        - When we are thoroughly equipped for every good work, we grow in our relationship with God, others are helped, and most importantly, God is glorified.

        - **But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.**
-- Matthew 6:33 (ESV)
        - -- 2 Corinthians 3:18
        - 
        - **14 For the love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. 
15 And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them. 
16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. 
17 So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! 
18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; 
19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. 
20 So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.**
-- 2 Corinthians 5:14-21 (NRSV)
        - 
        - **17 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.**
-- James 1:17 (TNIV)
        - 
        - **7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.**
-- Jeremiah 29:7 (ESV)
        - 
        - **14 And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth.**
--John 1:14 (NRSV)
        - 
        - **16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.**
-- Matthew 5:16 (NRSV)
        - 
        - **1 Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or take the path that sinners tread, or sit in the seat of scoffers; 
2 but their delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law they meditate day and night. 
3 They are like trees planted by streams of water, which yield their fruit in its season, and their leaves do not wither. In all that they do, they prosper.**
        - -- Psalm 1:1–3 (NRSV)
        - 
        - **31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. 
32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, 
33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved. 
1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.**
-- 1 Corinthians 10:31–11:1 (NRSV)
        - 
        - The 2nd century theologian and bishop, Irenaeus, effectively sets the dignity, identity, and __telos__ of the human person within the drama of God's reconciliation of all things in Christ, insisting that “the glory of God is man fully alive" to which he adds, "man’s life is the vision of God: if God’s revelation through creation has already obtained life for all the beings that dwell on earth, how much more will the Word’s manifestation of the Father obtain life for those who see God.” (CCC 294)
        - So, “The ultimate purpose of creation is that God ‘who is the creator of all things may at last become ‘all in all,’ thus simultaneously assuring his own glory and our beatitude’”(CCC 294).
        - "...revealing God indeed to men, but presenting man to God, and
preserving at the same time the invisibility of the Father, lest man should at any time become a despiser of God, and that he should always possess something towards which he might advance; but, on the other hand, revealing God to men through many dispensations, lest man, failing away from God altogether, should cease to exist. **For the glory of God is a living man; and the life of man consists in beholding God. For if the manifestation of God which is made by means of the creation, affords life to all living in the earth, much more does that revelation of the Father which comes through the Word, give life to those who see God.**
