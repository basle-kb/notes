    - [ ] ^^Decision^^:  Bob will review Policy Document to identify language that will discriminate policies that ought to be considered by Senate for "decisions" and what ought to be considered as a policy for "recommendation" to the Provost.
    - [ ] ^^Decision^^:  Brian and Aklilu will meet to discuss the viability, cost (financial and political) and projected outcomes of a "Connected Campus Launch Project" and whether or not the title, rather, should be: "Investigating a Connected Campus: Innovation, Promise, and Culture"
