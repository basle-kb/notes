    - 3. What lesson -- for changing the culture at Northwestern College -- are we to take from the following passage: 
    - --
    - > "The good news and the bad news about improving your skill in negotiation are the same: in order to influence others you must change your conduct. Think about it: you cannot *force* others to change; in a highly charged situation, the only factor you truly control is your own behavior. And changing your behavior...can have a powerful effect on the outcome."

    - #[The](<The.md>) Central Purpose of Christian Higher Education:
    - >*"to foster a deeper love for God and God's creation in ways that contribute to greater human flourishing (including our own)."[^1]*
    - [^1]: Ream and Glazer, “The Creation and Redemption of Learners and Learning” The Idea of a Christian College, 54.
    - Compare this statement with Northwestern College's mission: 
    - >*Northwestern College is a Christian academic community engaging students in courageous and faithful learning and living that empowers them to follow Christ and pursue God’s redeeming work in the world.*
    - --
    - Q. What important lesson did you take away from this passage: 
    - >"Our need to integrate faith and learning stems not from our imitation of God's actions in Scripture, but our human sinfulness. Only in a fallen world, does learning become secularized, so that faith and learning must once again be integrated. Fortunately, God is in the business of creating and also redeeming his fallen creation. By understanding our task as creating and redeeming learners and learning, we as educators and learners truly become image bearers of God."

    - As you think about helping to lead our educational mission at Northwestern College:

    - ##[The](<The.md>) Creation and Redemption of Advanced Learning (65-66)
    - 1. What, in general, distinguishes a university from a college?
    - 2. If this is true, what can / ought we to expect in terms of scholarship from our professors?
    - 3. Is the mission of "disseminating knowledge" rather than "engaging in creative scholarly projects" sufficient for Northwestern College (its faculty, trustees, constituency, and students)?

    - ## A Place From Which to Begin Creating a Renewed Academic Culture
    - What do you like about this sentence?
    - "For Christians, creating learning means producing culture that enhances our love of God, furthers human flourishing, gives insight into God's creation, or produces new cultural creations using the latent capacities within God's creation."*
    - [^2]: Ream and Glazer, “The Creation and Redemption of Learners and Learning” *The Idea of a Christian College*, 63.
    - --
    - >*Of the four distinct theological ideas found to have nourished the desire to learn and know in the Middle Ages (culminating in the creation of the first European universities), which one(s), if any, should we strive to highlight as we begin our new season of academic leadership together?*[^3]
    - [^3]: Ream and Glazer, “The Creation and Redemption of Learners and Learning” *The Idea of a Christian College*, 64.
    - --
    - In what specific way(s) does this following passage help you to better understand and articulate the importance of Northwestern College's mission statement: 
    - >*"Of course, Christ accomplished the ultimate redemption by restoring God's reign (the kingdom of God) but we are also asked to join in that work (i.e., freeing God's creation as well as human creatures from the bondage of the fall). Particularly in the area of redeeming human learning. Christian universities have a special understanding of this unique calling. Yet, it is important to realize that through common grace, anyone can be and is involved in advancing redemptive forms of learning that free aspects of God's creation from some effects of the fall."*[^4]

    - >*"The Christian University must set before students a grand vision of the Christian narrative that encompasses all of life. For if students are shuffled into career or professional placement counseling that mimics the same language and operates from the same paradigm as secular universities, the Christian university has failed...A creative and redemptive Christian university must be different."*[^5]
