                - around 1:40 an on-duty security officer received a call from two concerned and frightened female students in Jacobson Hall -- indicating that an unknown male, approximately 30 years old wearing a black t-shirt, black jeans, and a baseball hat) opened the door and they asked him what he wanted. 
                    - The male did not appear to be a student and claimed he was there just checking out the campus. The female students told him that he could not be in their room due to COVID and that he should leave and they would speak with him outside. Once the male left their room they immediately locked the door and called security. 
                - The SO arrived at Jacobson 4 minutes after the call, spoke to the female students and conducted a search of the building and surrounding area but could not locate the male.
                - at about 2:05, the SO assisted the fire safety officer with a pr-arranged fire drill at Skidmore. The drill concluded at 2:17 and the SO resumed his area search for the suspicious male. 
                - At approximately 2:20hrs the SO received another call on the security phone from a concerned male student in NWB who reported seeing a suspicious male wearing black clothing going through NWB and
entering dorm rooms. The SO immediately started to make his way towards NWB.
                - At approximately 2:22hrs the SO received a further call from another student at Robson Hall that a strange male dressed in a black t-shirt and black jeans was wondering through the Robson dorm and entering rooms.¬† The SO responded to Robson Hall.¬† While the SO was responding, a TWU Resident Director (RD) encountered the unknown male in the Robson front lobby.¬† The male appeared
confused and nervous and immediately left the dorm building. The RD began following the male outside when he saw the SO and pointed the male out to him.¬† The SO attempted to close the distance when the male turned around and saw the SO.¬† The RD assumed the SO had the situation in hand so he walked back to Robson Hall to check on the students.
                - Upon seeing the SO, the male immediately began to run up the stairs on the southeast corner of McMillan Hall with the SO closing the distance and advising the male to stop.¬† The male continued to run in
the direction of the Mattson parking lot and directly toward a TWU female student.¬† The SO then tackled the male to the ground and got him in a headlock.¬† The male began struggling to get away from the SO.¬† The SO told the male to stop struggling and continued to hold him on the ground.¬† A male  student approached and asked if he could
help and the SO told him to call the RCMP.¬†
                - The male student called 911 and was asked by the 911 operator to go to the front gate area to direct police when they arrived.
                - The male continued to struggle on the ground with the SO.¬† The RD observed the struggle from his Robson apartment window and returned to assist the SO control the male.¬† The RD then held down the legs of the male to prevent him from kicking the SO.¬†
                - The entire struggle lasted for approximately 15 to 20 minutes until
police arrived on the scene and took the male into custody.¬† As the police arrived the male became unresponsive and stopped breathing.¬† RCMP officers began CPR and called for paramedics.¬†
Langley Fire Department and ambulance arrived on scene approximately 10 minutes later and took over treating the male.
                - Security Manager Derek Adams (SM Adams) was advised of the incident by phone at 1513 hours by the SO and arrived on the scene
at 1526 hours.¬† Upon arrival, SM Adams observed paramedics conducting CPR on the male.¬†
SM Adams was able to briefly speak to the SO who advised him of the
circumstances and that he had held the male down in a headlock and struck him in the face with his fist several times, but did so in self-defence as the male continued to fight with him.¬† 
                - The SO complained of sore ribs and that the male spat blood in his face.¬† SM Adams attempted to get medical assistance for the SO from a paramedic.¬† The paramedic washed the eyes of the SO with a saline solution.
                - At approximately 4pm the male was transported to the hospital and the SO was taken into custody by the RCMP and arrested for Aggravated Assault.¬† SM Adams advised RCMP that the SO required medical evaluation at the hospital prior to being transported to the RCMP detachment.¬† 
                - At 11pm  the SO was released from custody with no charges; however, the SO was advised by the RCMP that they will be continuing the investigation.¬† The SO advised that he was not treated at the hospital. SM Adams advised the SO to get checked out at the hospital as soon as practicable
                - There were a number of students who witnessed the ensuing interaction between the unknown male and the SO.¬† These students were interviewed by the RCMP Serious Crimes Unit who were called to the scene due to the male‚Äôs serious medical condition.¬† Several of these students were interviewed by SM Adams and Cheryl Welfing on October 1, 2020, as part of TWU‚Äôs own internal investigation.
