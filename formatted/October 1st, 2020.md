            CURIE - Aklilu:
                CURIE who were already aware of the incident as they monitor police reports of their clients. They have assigned a law firm to advise us and the firm will contact us by tomorrow. I will receive the update on this by email from Denise and will share that info with you and Bob.

                Everything we have said up to this point has been good: 
                Next Steps:
                    Conduct internal review of evidence -- Jo
                    Carefully review Security Guard's social media accounts
                    Develop Crisis Communication Plans
                        Key:
                             ^^wait to speak until charges are laid^^
                            ^^while it seems unfeeling -- it is crucial to realize that TWU does not own this^^
                        Scenarios:
                            I. Individual passes
                            II. Security Guard is charged with manslaughter
                            III. RCMP releases the name of the security guard
                        Tactical Steps:
                            A. Gain clarity on Sequence of Events -  Jo
                            B. What has been handed to the RCMP - Jo
                            C. Who was involved - Jo
                            D. Speaking with the witnesses - Jo
                            E. Who is the RCMP contact person who is handling the file - Jo
                                would you give us a heads up on any upcoming statements
                                if they are going to release the name of the individual (security guard)
                            F. Develop Scenarios for Crisis Communication Plans - Mark, Winnie, James, Peter
                            G. Identify Spokesperson in case Scenario II or III occurs.

        Norm
            purview of RCMP
                default answer while it is being invisteigated
            Did anyone take photos or video
                scan social media of students
                we should search the guard's social media
                one photo, one video clip
            either the person will be ok, or will pass away.
        I. Prepare for:
            who are our security people, where were they trained?
            what to do with posts from RCMP -- post today
            Communications plan for each scenario
                1. individual is ok
                2. individual passes away
                3. security guard is charged
            
        II. Details
            Four Key Witnesses interviewed by Jo
                did the security guard follow the protocols laid out
                    a witness expressed fear for her safety
            Use of force, how it was applied, witnesses, etc.
            Out of an abundance of caution
            Guard is on leave of absence. 
            Does the guard have a family
            
        III. Questions
            Norm, what role could your firm play in helping TWU to best manage this situation if things do become more public and problematic?
            Who is the spokesperson for this event?
                If the person passes away: 
                    the president should explain sorrow...
                don't defend the indefensible
                are we confident that our protocols were followed - be cautious
                "under investigation by the RCMP, we are cooperating with the RCMP"
                    given access to CCTV
                    RCMP has our full support and we look forward to their results.
                        Q. how do we hire people?
            ^^Tactical Questions^^:
                1. Request for Interview
                2. P.R. Spokesperson
                    President
                    Senior Person assigned to serve in this capacity
                        someone high up in the organization
                3. Media Training
                    Four hour segments
                ^^4. Scenario Planning^^
                N.B. wait until charges are laid.

            F. 
        We hire individuals who have the appropriate training and certification. 
            we are assured that he had security accreditation and ongoing training. 
            that all of the protocols the U has in place were followed during the event. 
            ^^Q. did the individual use excessive force -- that is a matter for the RCMP to determine and the Crown to prosecute, beyond this we have no comment.^^
            Q. why do you hire your own organization -- we stand by a corporate decision to hire these employees and to ensure that they have our employees receive the appropriate training. 
            N.B. meeting - ensure that very little material that goes in writing. 
                Standup meeting with ELT leaders.

    ^^Remaining Key Questions: ^^
        Crisis Communication: who will speak for the University?
            We need to be prepared in case charges are brought or the intruder dies. 
        PACE Group
            How can we be prepared in case the shoe drops?
            Zoom call with Norm
            Give Pace all of our documentation
            Contact Jo - sequence of events, and all of the facts in place
            on the call: James, Winnie, Mark, Jo
    [Legal Counsel—TWU](<Legal Counsel—TWU.md>)
        PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
            Mark, Bob and Aklilu:
                I’ve now spoken with Darrel Schultz.  He has not asked Jack for a retainer and plans to bill just for the hours he spends on this.  I advised him about the support TWU will provide, up to $10,000 for pretrial steps.  I asked him to provide Jack with his regular invoice and also a “no details” invoice that Jack can provide to TWU.  Darrel is comfortable with TWU paying him directly.  He completely understands that his only professional obligation is to Jack.
            A few other details we discussed:
                Jack has been released.  Darrel will find out whether it was “on his own recognizance” (suggesting that charges are imminent) or if he was just released without anything further, for the time being.  Darrel believes it is the latter, but that does not mean that charges won’t be forthcoming in the future.  A fairly recent SCC decision held that from the date of charge, trials must be complete within 30 months, so sometimes charges are delayed until the investigation is complete.
                Jack was given a Charter warning for aggravated assault and then later for murder.  This was done so that Jack appreciates the jeopardy he is in if he speaks to police or gives any statement.  Darrel agrees with me that murder is not likely here, although it is possible that might be the charge.  If the person dies, manslaughter would likely be the potential worst outcome for Jack.
                Darrel told me that the RCMP had requested video footage from TWU, which I didn’t know.  Presumably TWU will be providing this to the RCMP.  Darrel understands that TWU will be cooperating with the RCMP.
