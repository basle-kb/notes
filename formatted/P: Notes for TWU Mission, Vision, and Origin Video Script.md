- SCRIPT
    - **Introduction**
        - Hello, as President of Trinity Western University, its my privilege to introduce you to this remarkable Christian University. 
        - When you meet someone for the first time, they sometimes ask, "where are *you* from?
            - When they ask this, they are trying to get at your "origin story" the place where your story begins. 
            - Let me tell you about the beginning of Trinity Western University. 
        - **A. Holy Ground – Founding Story**
            - In 1957, a small group of Christians met to discuss an extraordinary dream: they wanted to establish a Christian University in Canada. 
            -  
            - Why was this an extraordinary dream?
            - You see, at that time, Canada had several world-class Universities. But these founders knew that it did not have a distinctly Christian University. 
            - Their dream was for a school in which Christ had preeminence, where students would not only receive a high-quality University education, but where they would also be given be granted a transformative foundation in knowledge of God and the Scriptures, and at that time no such institution existed in Canada.
            - They knew that 
            - LW: I certainly know him from photographs, and I have seen him around--very busy
            - soul, too. (laughs) That’s very interesting, because I haven’t learned a lot about the
            - board. **I’d like to go back now to the time when, uh, you had a story to tell me I think--**
            - **about a Reverend Cahill? He was a Wheaton graduate.**
            - …
            - DE: Yeah, Walter Cahill. Yes, see he was a member of the School for Canada
            - Committee and we were the committee that was charged with the responsibility to
            - discover the campus on which we should begin. And again and again we came to this
            - property, first of all through the personality of Henry Friesen, who would take us
            - individually at times and show it to us--he’d taken me here many times. And uh, we
            - were here all together on this day--it was before we had ever made the purchase, but we
            - had met in thorough discussion before we had came here, and uh, well, Ruby and I lived
            - in Langley at that time, and I remember they were guests at our home, all of them, and
            - we uh, (sound of door opening; whispering) we uh, drove out here, I think we were nine
            - or ten persons that were on campus at the time, and Henry was walking us through,
            - showing us the beauty of the terrain and this sort of thing, and we noticed that Walter
            - Cahill had stopped. And uh, I moved back to Walter, and I said, **“Walter, what it**
            - **the world are you doing?” He said, “I’m taking the shoes off of my feet, I want to walk**
            - **on this ground in my stocking (banging noise) feet because I believe I am walking on**
            - **holy ground. I’m coveting this ground for the Wheaton of Canada.”**
            - **LW: Oh, that’s the way he put it--the Wheaton of Canada. So he really had a vision then,**
            - **he really felt--that’s good.**
            - **So how did this come about?**
            - And that for Christians to truly follow Christ, they needed a place that would help them *learn* how to connect every part of who they were created to be. And there is no better place in which to do this than a truly excellent Christian University. 
            - And these men knew, that at that time, no such University existed in Canada. 
            - This dream began to take shape when the Evangelical Free Church of America appointed a committee to travel north and explore the possibility of establishing a liberal arts college in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia.
            - In 1957 when the Evangelical Free Churches of America (EFCA) appointed a committee to explore establishing a liberal arts college in the Fraser Valley. David Enarson, a Christian educator and church leader, with a vision for an accredited Christian university, was one of the guiding members of the committee. Members of the committee purchased the Seal Kap dairy farm in British Columbia's Fraser Valley and developed plans to build the college. Trinity Western University started as Trinity Junior College in 1962.
            - Since its first days in 1962, Trinity Western has held a unique vision for Christian liberal arts and sciences education in Canada. The first president Dr. Calvin B. Hanson (1962-1974) helped shape the early vision. Two decades later, with 800 students enrolled, the college achieved two important milestones. In 1984, under the leadership of TWU’s second president, Dr. R. Neil Snider (1974-2006), Trinity Western was granted full membership in the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), and in 1985, the British Columbia legislature renamed the Trinity Western College Act the Trinity Western University Act, establishing TWU as a university.
            - The next milestones for the University included incorporating ACTS Seminaries and the School of Graduate studies, which offer masters and doctoral programs in theological studies, counselling psychology, and humanities.
            - TWU leads the way in Canada for Christian liberal arts education, and offers 42 undergraduate and 17 graduate degree programs. TWU has earned national recognition in educational surveys for its overall quality of education reported in __The Globe and Mail University Report__ and __Maclean’s__ magazine. TWU has four Canada Research Chairs: in Developmental Genetics and Disease; Interpretation, Religion, and Culture; Dead Sea Scrolls Studies; and in Patient-Reported Outcomes.
            - Trinity Western University provides a wide array of learning experiences, whether degree or non-degree, in its satellite campuses and through its various schools and institutes.
            -  that would focus on the education of whole persons. 
            - You see, this group of Christians knew that when a Pharisee asked Jesus, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" Jesus answered with these words:
            - >"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind" to which he added, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself"..."On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets"
            - Those Christians who shared a dream that Canada would have a he founding fathers of Trinity Western University knew that there is a deep and abiding connection between loving God and loving your neighbor, and that learning, the life of the mind, plays a crucial role in all of this. 
            - One day, when walking across a beautiful piece of land that they thought would be a perfect place for Trinity, the Reverend Walter Cahill paused, bent down, and began taking off his shoes. 
            - His friends noticed, and when one of them asked, "what are you doing?"
            - Rev. Cahil's response was perceptive and spiritually revealing. He said:
            -  “I’m taking the shoes off my feet…because I believe I am walking on __holy ground.__” 
            - ^^Holy Ground indeed! -- that's what this place has turned to be.^^
                - ^^Canada's finest Christian University began in this place, with shared vision, planted in the soil of hope and promise.^^
        - 
        - 
        -   in Canada, and it remains so even now.
        - Canada has many academically strong Universities, but none of them combines the quality of academic education and depth of care and attention to development of students as whole and effective persons depth and care for the full development of students as does Trinity. 
        - They one that would focus on educating the whole person transformative Christian education while gaining national recognition as a . 
        - 
        - **B. Mission**
            - Trinity Western University has grown to become Canada's premiere global Christian university with a mission to develop godly Christian leaders: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life."
                - [TWU Mission](<TWU Mission.md>)
                    - to develop godly Christian leaders: 
                        - positive, goal-oriented university graduates
                            - with thoroughly Christian minds;
                        - growing disciples of Jesus Christ
                            - who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, 
                                - serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life."
            - This is a vital mission -- the world desperately needs godly Christian leaders, positive, goal-oriented individuals who have been taught how to think about the world in light of the truth and calling of Christ. And then, to help each of these students launch into professional and public life well — so that they can impact the world with the love, mercy, and truth of the Gospel. 
            - This is a fantastic mission, but how does it connect to your life? 
            - Another way of thinking about this is to ask "__why might God be calling you to attend Trinity Western University?" __
            - or, if you have already sensed this cal,__ "how might God use this remarkable Christian University to impact the rest of your life?" __
        - **C. Vision**
            - The final two lines of the poem "The Summer Day" by [Mary Oliver](<Mary Oliver.md>) go like this: 
            - >Tell me, what is it you plan to do
>with your one wild and precious life?
            - We know that it is an immense privilege to be able to come alongside each student and say: 
>"tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?"
            - Not every student that enrolls at Trinity is seeking to follow Christ, and not every student who knows Christ knows how to pursue a full and meaningful life.
Now, that's ok, as long as you have a community that is invested in helping you to figure out how to live a cohorent life.
            - So what is a coherent life?
            - It is a life where you know how to connect three things:
                - 1. Who are you?
                - 2. What do you believe?, and
                - 3. What are you doing in the world?
            - Yes, our mission to develop godly Christian leadres. is to aking sense of our unique set of ability,
gifts, experience and intellect.
            - Discerning the connection between what you believe, who you are, and what you will do in the world is key to living a full, rewarding, and meaningful life.
            - The great news is this: Trinity Western University exist to help students develop a plan for your one wild and precious life. 
            - A Trinity Western University education prepares
students to live a vital Christian faith with intellectual rigor, creativity
and hope—seeking to nurture the habits of mind and practice that sustain a
faithful and compelling witness amidst dramatic cultural change—by connecting
theology to life. A diverse and increasingly fragmented world is in great need
of leaders who seek to be agents of hope, healing and renewal.
            - We believe it is critical for every student to have the opportunity to reflect upon, pray about, and develop a plan for their one wild, and precious life. 
Each life is a precious gift, and each of us have been given a unique set of gifts, abilities, passions, and calling. One of the things that makes us distinct from almost every other University in Canada, is our commitment to the development of the whole person. 
            - As a remarkable Christian University, you will have great professors and will be prepared for graduate school and for work. 
            - However, one of most promising and distinctive features of the Trinity Western University experience is our strategic decision to But by focusing on the development and growth of the whole person -- by inviting students to think more deeply about who they want to become, to help them to connect this to their deepest values, and to join all of this to God's 
            - We work hard to give students the kind of education that helps them to launch well into their next recognize and  es, Trinity Western University will provide you with great professors, and interesting things to study, but like Mary Oliver, we are interested in 
            - lso our most important and unique features of this University is our commgtment
