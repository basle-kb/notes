**INTRODUCTION**
    - Hello, as President of Trinity Western University, its my privilege to introduce you to this remarkable Christian University. 
    - When you meet someone for the first time, they sometimes ask, "where are *you* from?
        - When they ask you this, they are showing an interest in you, and they might be trying to get at your "origin story" -- the place where your story begins.  
        - Let me tell you about the beginning of Trinity Western University. 
**I. Origin: Holy Ground**
    - In 1957, a small group of Christians met to share an extraordinary dream. 
    - You see, at the time, Canada had several world-class Universities, and a number of Bible Colleges.  
    - If you were searching for the quality and challenge of a University education, and also wanted to grow in your understanding of the Christian faith, you would have to study outside of Canada.
    - These founders had a dream to build a Christian college that would allow students to spend two years taking general-education courses under the care of committed Christian professors who would help students to connect their learning to the call of God upon their lives. 
    - Their dream began to take shape when the Evangelical Free Church of America appointed a "School for Canada Committee" to find a suitable place to launch a liberal arts college in which Christ had preeminence. 
        - One day, the committee was walking through a beautiful piece of land in the Fraser Valley, and they noticed that Walter Cahill had stopped. David Enarson turned around and asked, "Walter, what in the world are you doing?" to which Walter replied:
>"I'm taking my shoes off, I want to walk on this ground in my stocking feet because I believe that I am walking on holy ground" 
to which he added:
>"I'm coveting this ground for the Wheaton of Canada". 
    - Holy Ground indeed! 
    - Almost 60 years on, Trinity Western University has earned national recognition for its quality of education, it has attracted world-class professors, and has become Canada's finest Christian global University educating about 5,000 students each year with undergraduate, graduate, seminary, and adult degree completion programs. 
**II. Mission**
    - Throughout Europe and throughout the United States you will find Universities that started with a Christian mission, but have since walked away from their Christian heritage. 
    - This is not the case with Trinity Western University. 
    - We value and seek to live out our mission: 
        - to develop godly Christian leaders: 
            - positive, goal-oriented university graduates
                - with thoroughly Christian minds;
            - growing disciples of Jesus Christ
                - who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, 
                    - serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life."
        - This is a fantastic mission, but how does it connect to your life? 
            - Its true, the world desperately needs godly Christian leaders, who know who they are, what they believe, and are able to make a positive impact upon the institutions and communities of which they are a part.  
        - At Trinity Western University, every staff member, professor, or student leader know how privileged we are to be here: 
            - Not only do we have the honor of caring for, teaching, and pouring into the lives of gifted and eager students, but we get to see, first-hand, God's stunning work in the lives of our students. 
        - Our mission is lived out every day -- and we get to see God at work in the lives of about 5,000 students. 
        - You might be wondering, Trinity Western University sounds like a wonderful  happen if Trinity Western University  but how does it connect to your life? 
        - Why does  
**III. Vision**
    - We are organizing the University around a unique question: 
- what job or challenge does each student need to "hire" the University to do?
    - - while graduate and undergraduate students have different needs, but they do have one thing in common:
    - > they are trying to figure out how to flourish in work and life. 
    - - this is where a Trinity Western University education is really valuable: because we are committed to helping every student to figure out a plan for their life. 
    - There is a wonderful poet by the name of: 
how to think about the world in light of the truth and calling of Christ. And then, to help each of these students launch into professional and public life well — so that they can impact the world with the love, mercy, and truth of the Gospel. 

 
>Thankfully there are some innovative thinkers who are willing to challenge traditional and outdated notions of what a liberal arts degree should offer. Andy Chan, the Vice President of Personal & Career Development at [Wake Forest University](http://www.forbes.com/colleges/wake-forest-university/) is [leading a charge](http://rethinkingsuccess.wfu.edu/files/2013/05/A-Roadmap-for-Transforming-The-College-to-Career-Experience.pdf) to help institutions realize that the goals of delivering a high quality liberal arts education and helping students get jobs are not mutually exclusive.
