- Emmaus Scholars Program —  Self-Assessment, June 2014
- # Introduction
- The Emmaus Scholars Program is an innovative one-year program (comprised of 15 Hope College Sophomores and Juniors) in intentional Christian community focused upon integral mission. 
- ## Mission
- This innovative program in “lived theology” employs an experiential-learning model that integrates theological reflection, intentional community and a commitment to integral mission. 
- The focus upon integral mission provides a scholarly, spiritually meaningful, and moral order within which students can inquire after, seek to embody and demonstrate their love of God and neighbor in a wholly integrated fashion.
- ## Strategic Significance of the Program
- The Emmaus Scholars Program is a strategic implementation of Hope’s goal of linking three critical program areas of the college: Academic, Campus Ministries, and Student Development. Working together, these three elements provide students with a supportive, spiritually vital and academically challenging learning experience.
    - As an is innovative program in “lived theology” — the Emmaus Scholars Program privileges experiential learning, theological reflection, intentional community and a commitment to integral mission. The focus upon integral mission provides a scholarly, spiritually meaningful, and moral order within which students can inquire after, seek to embody and demonstrate their love of God and neighbor in a wholly integrated fashion.
- ## Christian Community
- Commenting upon the real blessing of the physical presence of other Christians, Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes:
    - "It is easily forgotten that the community of Christians is a gift of grace from the kingdom of God, a gift that can be taken from us any day—that the time still separating us from the most profound loneliness may be brief indeed. Therefore, let those who until now have had the privilege of living a Christian life together with other Christians praise God’s grace from the bottom of their hearts. Let them thank God on their knees and realize: it is grace, nothing but grace, that we are still permitted to live in the community of Christians today." (29-30)	
- Christian community only exists in Christ. There are all sorts of other, more general, notions of "community". The task and privilege that lies ahead for each of us in the Emmaus Scholars Program, is to discover, nurture, cherish, and share in genuine Christian community. 
- The Emmaus Scholars Program provides a cohort of emerging adults with a vital context in which to to experience intentional Christian community. By meeting for daily prayer, coursework, fellowship, discussions, "Mennonite dinners", and sharing in the work of community development and justice, we seek to live out the Gospel of Christ in winsome and caring ways.  Inviting guests to share our community in prayer, over meals, discussions, and in service, allows for hospitality, learning, and outreach.
- # I. Execution of Key Goals of the Program
- The Emmaus Scholars Program is an intentional Christian community that integrates a number of key  elements in faith and practice. Key to the program is the execution of an experiential learning model of pedagogy.
- ![Experiential Learning Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1a3dqrm3lqmbcae/Screenshot%202014-06-11%2014.40.12.png)
- Through guided experiential-learning opportunities, reflection and conversation on the nature of identity, community, self-giving, discipleship, integral mission, and culture care, we aim to foster deep and critical reflection upon moral, social, theological and cultural witness. The fruits of individual and shared reflection, journaling, and joint research, are brought together in a final summative presentation. Students are given opportunities to reflect back upon and process these experiences in order to foster deep connections between faith, justice, reconciliation, and social responsibility.
- The following documents how these goals were achieved throughtout the course of the first year of the pilot stage of the program.
- ## I. Critical Thinking
- Fully aware of the diverse sociological and intellectual impediments to Christian formation among emerging adults, the Emmaus Scholars Program is committed to fostering a high level of academic, spiritual, moral and experiential learning in the service of discovering the meaning and significance of integral mission. 
- Accordingly, this program provides a select group of Hope College students with a unique opportunity to connect their learning, spiritual and moral formation to the biblical promise that Christ will truly be all in all (Col 3:10).  
- Academic work undertaken by Emmaus Scholars includes collaborative research, a seminar “Reconciliation and Integral Mission”; a leadership course, “Team Building, Servant Leadership, Christian Perspective”; and an experiential learning course, “Integral Mission and Community” for a total of 10 credits. 
- *The Leading goals of the Curriculum were as follows**:
- 1. To help a cohort of Hope College students to embody a life-long commitment to integral mission. 
- 2. To help Emmaus Scholars to grow intellectually, socially, academically, spiritually, and morally.
- 3. To connect deep patterns of biblical justice to the concrete needs of communities by learning and practicing integral mission and thus share in God’s reconciliation of the world in Christ.
- 4. To publish the best of our research on integral mission so that others (faculty, researchers, students, Christian leaders) may come to better understand and share in integral mission. 
- 5. To discover, and employ gifts of servant-leadership within the Emmaus cohort, the Hope College community and the surrounding neighborhood.
- Critical Thinking Skills were developed in the course of completing the following pieces of academic work:

- ## Moral Vision
- (Biblical Understanding of Justice and the Kingdom of God)
- One of the ways in which we sought to develop a deeper moral vision of the kingdom of God was through what is called "Mennonite Dinners". These dinners took place every Sunday evening (from 5-7:30pm). These dinners served to:
- provide a concrete setting for intentional Christian community by having Emmaus students take turns shopping for food and preparing the dinners, setting up and taking down the tables, chairs, etc., and washing dishes together.
- expose students to inviduals whose lives and work embody the kind of moral commitments to justice that the students were learning about in more formal settings.
- Provide a forum in which Emmaus students could ask formative questions about vocation and Christian witness.
- enabled students to learn from the following dinner guests:
