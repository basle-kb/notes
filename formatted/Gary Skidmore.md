## [August 19th, 2020](<August 19th, 2020.md>)
- Because of the ongoing problem with the installation and funding of the Elevator for Skidmore hall, I responded to an email from [Tom Skidmore ](<Tom Skidmore .md>), and also wrote to [Alan Skidmore](<Alan Skidmore.md>) and blind-copied the letter to [Cary Skidmore](<Cary Skidmore.md>) and [Gary Skidmore](<Gary Skidmore.md>).
