- Yesterday’s blog focused on the structure of strategic plans, asking whether they are built from the mission statement backwards or from upwards from a checklist of ideas people had without looking at the overall picture? (answer: for the most part they are built from checklists and hence are not particularly strategic, though they as planning documents they may work perfectly fine). Today we’re going to dig into the substance of plans in a little bit more detail, based on examinations of institutional strategic plans at 39 universities (26 of which are in Canada) and 11 colleges and polytechnics in Canada. Additionally, we examined 40 North American university faculty plans in the fields of Engineering, Law, Medicine and Public Health.
- At a structural level, every plan is built around a set of themes – anywhere between two and nine of them (mode= 4, and 9 is actually crazy). Beneath that set of themes are a set of goals: things the institution specifically commits itself to accomplishing over the course of a five-year period. In most cases, strategic plans attach somewhere between three and five goals to each theme.
- (As this blog has [previously noted](), there is absolutely no good reason for strategic plans to be five years long, other than some weird genuflection to Gleb Krzhizhanovsky and all those other fun guys at Gosplan. Yet you would have to look very hard to find plans of any other duration. Guess it must be all those hard-left radicals in senior administration.)
- Below the goals are what you might call “tactics” – that is, activities which lead to or support the goals/themes. Not all strategies publish these, since they basically deal with operational minutiae: important to keep track of for the purpose of keeping on track, but institutions who want to use the strategic plan as a public communications document often prefer not to incorporate this information in their strategic plan because it makes for pretty clunky reading. By our count, only about a third of institutions put these operational-level details in their plans for public viewing.
- Universities are often thought of as being isomorphic, always pursuing similar aims. And, looking through their strategic plans, you’d find a fair bit of backing for that idea. Because guess what the top three themes are, in terms of popularity?
- Are you ready for this? Hold on to something:
- 1)      Teaching and Learning/Student Success (a theme in 66% of plans)
- 2)      Engaging in Community Partnerships (64%)
- 3)      Improved Research Performance (58%)
- The plans that fail to include these aims as strategic themes tend to include them as goals or tactics in service of another theme. Thus, when we look beyond the strategic themes, we see that efforts to engage in community partnerships are included in 98% of plans, improved teaching and learning in 96% and improved research performance in 82%.
- So, surprise, surprise, Canadian post-secondary institutions want to focus on the incredibly innovative trio of teaching, research and community service. Although when we say “community service,” we should not get carried away with the idea that institutions are actually excited about engaging with the communities in which they are actually located. Remarkably, fewer than half of the institutions which claimed to make “community partnerships” or spoke more broadly of the local community managed not to mention the name of the community in which they were located. This is…not good.
- There were another bunch of ideas which occasionally appeared as themes but which more often appeared as goals: Equity, Diversion and Inclusion (16% of plans had this as themes, 74% as “goals”), environmental sustainability (22% as themes and 50% as goals) Indigenization (12% and 48%), and “meeting industry needs” or “labour market demands” (10% and 46%). These are all relatively standard parts of the Canadian higher education discourse, of course – nothing surprising about seeing them on this list. But is interesting to see where they all land in terms of frequency. Maybe the most intriguing set of ideas to be found in institutional plans are around institutional adaptability or resiliency, which shows up as a theme in 28% of plans, and as a goal in another 24%. We’d argue, given the times, that this is probably an under-explored theme for most universities.
- If we think of strategic plans as a navigation tool – specifically, as a statement of where an institution wants to go – it is actually quite remarkable how few institutions choose to explain when they think they will have arrived. Only about a quarter of strategic plans include some kind of metrics which indicate when certain goals will have been achieved (more among polytechnics, less among colleges). Now this isn’t totally crazy – not all goals have obvious numerical targets (e.g. “bring graduation rate up to 80%). And so some institutions have plans which don’t include metrics, but if you convert the goals into checklists, another quarter or so of plans can be said to have “measurable outcomes.” But even so, in about half of all institutional plans there is genuinely no way for an outside observer to tell whether the plan has been achieved or not.
- Faculty-level plans are a bit different. For one thing, there are a lot fewer fancy words about mission and vision, for the very simple reason that faculties (professional ones anyway) have a greater sense of common purpose. This does not mean that they are less strategic in outlook: in fact, faculty plans tend to be__more__ strategic in the sense that their plans are made of pillars not buckets. In effect, because they have narrower interests, strategic plans tend not to be used as instruments for trading off political interests (which is a very important factor behind the “bucket” style of strategic plan). That doesn’t, however, mean their structure is all that different from institutional-level plans. The top three themes are still research, teaching and either labour market alignment (Engineering) or unspecified community engagement (all other fields), and only half of them provide anything like enough detail to provide metrics for determining whether or not the plan has actually been accomplished.
- This isn’t quite a comprehensive look at institutional plans: we’ve still got a few to plough through in Canada, and we’re looking at trying to make some reasonable comparisons to plans in other countries. We expect to put this out as a publication sometime in the next few months: if you have any suggestions for additional things we could look for or compare, we’d love to hear from you.
