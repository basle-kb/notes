- [ ] [Write](<Write.md>) Kauffeldt's Card
    - One inspiring example of the moral courage we've seen in our alumni community during this time comes from Trinity Western double alumna, Dr. Bev Kauffeldt (’93, ’03). When thousands of Canadians were scrambling to return home last week, Dr. Kauffeldt bravely left Canada for Cremona, Italy, where **[she is providing leadership and medical care in a 68-bed field hospital south of Milan](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/corbella-canadians-helping-in-the-centre-of-italys-covid-19-storm/?utm_source=ALUMNI+MASTER+LIST&utm_campaign=b64d2497db-EMAIL_Chapter_MN_Launch_2016_11_23_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2d8fe90460-b64d2497db-&mc_cid=b64d2497db&mc_eid=[UNIQID]).**
    - This is no easy thing. As you know, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic threatening lives and economies throughout the world. It is our prayer that God will protect, strengthen, and guide medical workers, like Dr. Kauffeldt, who are providing vital and life-saving care.
    - Note for Kauffeldt's
    - Thank you for your great idea about contacting Samaritans Purse. I was able
    - to get some suggested sizes for Kendell and Bev and I received an updated
    - address for them that we didn't have in the TWU system.
    -  The TWU jackets
    - are ready to send to them as soon as your note (or letter) is ready.
