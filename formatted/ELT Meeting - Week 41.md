    - 1. Discussion of the results of the [ELT Typeform Survey -- October 14, 2020](<ELT Typeform Survey -- October 14, 2020.md>) https://markhusbands186063.typeform.com/to/UqMZhbQ6
        - Note: 
            - the sample size is small
            - I did not give you much context
                - I also did not direct you to answer the question in a way that you thought perhaps I would want you to answer or to answer in a way that is utterly true. 
                    - For the record, I prefer "utterly true" and when we work together as ELT I am not generally asking for marketing language or postures so you might want to clarify your answer if it shows up on the screen. 
                - It is also worth asking: what does the range of response and perhaps even misunderstanding of certain things reveal about us.

-= we are at a distinct disadvantage if we studied in Canada
                - desire is there, 
                - role modelling is not there
                - having Ph.D.'s in any of our areas and finding theologically grounded Christian scholars in various disciplines is very difficult.
                - this is not a personal flaw, but more a reflection of the state of higher education in Canada. 
                - do faculty - as a whole, recognize this deficit? is there a willingness to do anything about this?
                - many faculty come to Trinity Western University because they want to grow in these areas.
                - ^^Is Faculty Faith & Learning a key priority for the University^^?
