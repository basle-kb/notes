**But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
-- Matthew 6:33 (ESV)**

**14 For the love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. 
15 And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them. 
16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. 
17 So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! 
18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; 
19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. 
20 So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
-- 2 Corinthians 5:14-21 (NRSV)**

**17 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
-- James 1:17 (TNIV)**

    **Mission Statement**
        "The mission of Trinity Western University, as an arm of the Church, is to develop godly Christian leaders: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

        Note: if you look carefully at the syntax or grammatical structure of this sentence you notice, a clause and a colon.
        "^^The mission of Trinity Western University^^, as an arm of the Church, ^^is to develop godly Christian leaders^^: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

            In a sense, the actual mission of TWU is ^^to develop godly Christian leaders^^.
                everything else serves to develop what we mean by "godly Christian leaders".
    **Why do we need a Vision Statement?**
        What: our current mission states **what** Trinity Western University does.
            **What does Trinity Western University do?**
            Answer: ^^develop godly Christian leaders^^.
            Others may question or seek to replace this mission with something else -- in order to shift the strategic direction of the university to pursue some other goal, but **this** is what we have committed ourselves to do. **Developing godly Christian leaders is why Trinity Western University exists**.
            It does not adequately express **why** we do this.
        However, there are two related questions that follow from this observation?
            ^^What will happen in the world if we are successful in carrying out this mission?^^ and
            ^^How will the world be better because Trinity Western University was faithful in carrying out its distinctly Christian calling and mission as a global Christian University?^^
        
    **What could a VISION STATEMENT** accomplish?
        Imaginative Challenge:
            Imagine if 30,000 TWU alumni had been formed by the very best of a TWU education -- how would the world be different? what impact would TWU have upon the world?
            
    **What Problem (Job to be done) does our Vision Statement need to solve/address?**
        What is the **Job to be done** for...
        1. STUDENTS?
            What struggle are they experiencing in their lives?
                1. who they are
                2. what they believe
                3. what to do in the world
        2. (the) WORLD?
            What struggle(s) is the world experiencing?
                1. navigating cultural, ethnic, religious __differences__?
                2. navigating the __dissolution__ of intellectual/moral consensus on what is true and good: with the consequence of tribalism and suspicion of the "other".
                3. no agreed-upon vision of human identity or flourishing (beyond consumption and comfort) 
            3. (the) TRIUNE GOD?
                1. has God clearly revealed his purpose for the world and Trinity Western University?
                2. do we offer the world a compelling and true witness of God's  we actively pursuing God's justice, reconciliation, and truth in the world?
                3. are we  we understand God's redemptive purposes for the world?
        for the world: 
2 Corinthians 5:14–21 (ESV)
14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; 
15 and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. 
16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. 
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 
18 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; 
19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 
20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
If we lack unity in carrying out our stated mission with the goal of achieving our new vision, Trinity Western University will not reach its potential.
We need to be willing to ask ourselves a very pointed series of questions: 
    a. why are we here?
    b. how might the triune God use and bless our efforts?
    c. what is God's measure of __success__?
    d. who, or what, is central to our work?
    e. where are we heading?
