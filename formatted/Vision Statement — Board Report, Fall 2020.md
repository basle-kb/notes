INTRODUCTION
    Why does Trinity Western University exist? What is our final measure of success? These are both challenging and entirely fitting questions to ask amidst disruptive and challenging times. I am thrilled to have been able to share the wonderful news that **Trinity Western University has just received the highest enrolment in its 58-year history.** Fall 2020 enrolment is 4,774 students, up from 4,476 in 2019. Overall university enrolment has increased 6.7% over last year. At the same time, I am painfully aware that God's gracious provision also demanded a corresponding sacrifice on behalf of the majority of the Trinity Western University community. 
    Having reached the fall with this stunningly positive achievement in enrolment, it might be tempting for some to begin to make plans to "return to normal." And yet, we are all living through a devastating global pandemic. However there are very good reasons to resist the illusory comfort of a dream of "returning to normal." 
    Despite the hardship, disruption, and challenges of seeking to advance the work of Canada's leading global Christian University amidst COVID-19, this season has also afforded us unforeseen opportunities for growth, clarity, innovation, and adaptation. Indeed, from the onset of COVID-19, my hope and prayer is that Trinity Western University would emerge from this crisis a stronger, more agile, innovative, and mission-focused institution than when we began. 
    Why do we exist, and how will we measure our success?
    The following report is a collection of observations, facts, and otherwise laudable accomplishments and goals. The material included is both helpful and needed. An engaged and committed Board ought to have, at hand, this collection of material. In an effort to provide you with a basis upon which to evaluate, and hopefully endorse, recent efforts to articulate a "vision statement" for the University I have added a final section focused on "Mission & Vision." I am confident knowing that we share a common hope and belief that our gracious Lord will not abandon us amidst COVID-19. Indeed God commands us not to fear, for he will strengthen, help, and uphold us by his "victorious right hand." (cf. Isaiah 41:10). 

MISSION & VISION
    Why do we exist, and how will we measure our success?
    Eight weeks after returning to Apple, Steve Jobs held a “team meeting” with Apple Employees to introduce an entirely new strategy for product development and marketing. 
    In the course of this talk, Jobs expressed a point of view that could help Trinity Western University over the next few years. Listen to this comment by Steve Jobs:
        "To me, marketing is about values. This is a very complicated world. It is a very noisy world. And, were not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us. No company is. And so we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us." 
    To which Jobs added: 
        "Even a great brand needs investment and caring if it going to retain its relevance and vitality...our customers want to know "who is Apple, and what is it that we stand for, where do we fit in the world"."
    Do our friends, donors, students, alumni, and parents, know who TWU is, what TWU stands for, and where we fit in the world?
    **In a noisy, competitive, and largely post-Christian West, have we been really clear on what we want people to remember about us?**
    This is where the question of mission & vision come in. 
    The assumption here is this: in order to succeed in helping others know and hopefully value what Trinity Western University is about, and what we stand for, it is necessary to have institutional clarity and commitment to a common vision. 
    Put differently, in order to be sure that we are pursuing the right goals, and devoting finite resources to the most important areas of the University, we need to have a clear sense of where we are going. If we can't answer "why we exist, or how we measure success" we will not reach the potential and fulfill the mission that God has given us. 
    **Focusing on Purpose / Calling**
        In the remarkable book by Tim Clydesdale, __The Purposeful Graduate: Why Colleges Must Talk to Students about Vocation__, we learn the following:
            >”What limits students’ genuine learning and authentic citizenship is not inefficiencies in colleges’ or universities’ organizational structures (about which most students are oblivious), but students’ dominant orientation to their education. When students view college education as a means to an economic end and not an opportunity to learn, explore, and investigate the world, even the most efficient college or university will not foster genuine learning or engaged citizenship.” (203)
        Given the cost of higher education, it is understandable that many students -- both undergraduate and graduate -- will view University education in transactional terms. Clydesdale is rightly concerned that when students view their education in a transactional manner, it will be difficult to foster genuine learning and engaged citizenship. So what is his response or anti-dote to this? It is for Colleges and Universities to focus on calling. Listen to  how he expresses this point: 
            >”There is one place, though, where colleges and universities do possess responsibility for aimless and lengthy wandering by college graduates. That place is higher education’s retreat from questions of purpose and vocation. I am not the first to claim this retreat, but I may be the first to link this retreat to the unnecessary and often harmful wanderings of newly college-educated emerging adults. By not engaging questions of purpose and vocation, colleges and universities leave the individualist and traditionalist cultural trajectories of American youth untouched, dropping graduates into active earthquake zones without drinking water or a map. It is no wonder why today’s families have had to stretch like “accordions” to accommodate twenty-somethings — paying a “private toll” for global competitiveness; why nearly half of emerging adults meet the criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder; and why so many are “adrift” if not “lost in transition” — living lives marked by consumerism, civic disengagement, and anomic morality.” (205)
    To which Clydesdale insists: 
        >”Colleges and universities must equip graduates for the long slog from commencement to stable employment and productive citizenship, because if they do not, in an era of reductionism and simple-minded accountability, they will find themselves culpable for the whole of the long slog itself. Where job fairs and résumé workshops once provided all that was necessary to put graduates on the path to financial independence (the baseline for adult achievement), there must now exist systematic processes to help students identify their interests, understand global change, and launch interdependent post college journeys.” (205)
    It is evident that students need a University education that focuses on larger questions than simply "preparing students for work." The focus on purpose or calling, affords students the opportunity to gain clarity on identity, belief, and what it takes to have a lasting impact upon the world.  longer view than merely preparing one for work. Few Universities in Canada are equipped to face these question, and even fewer have the intellectual, moral, and theological convictions to provide students with normative judgements and guidance. This, I suggest, is *exactly* the point at which Trinity Western University can make a unique, meaningful, and lasting impact upon University education in Canada; and the benefit of us devoting resources, focus, and energy to this task will be remarkable. 
    If we were to help the world see that a Trinity Western University education is unique in its focus upon knowing each student with the goal of ensuring that each individual is given the opportunity to develop a strategy and plan for their life, we would have a much easier time convincing people of the unique value of a Trinity Western University education. 
    Not only would focusing upon personal and career development have an outsized impact upon the lives of our students, but it is also one of the most strategic investments we can make in the future of Trinity Western University. This is why we need to agree upon a shared and compelling vision statement. 
    To this end, I respectfully submit the following for your consideration. 
    
    VISION
        In an effort to achieve clarity on a possible vision statement for the University, we sought to identify a **problem** or **struggle** that emerging adults (18-29) are, by and large, facing.
        This task requires a degree of empathy and understanding. At the same time, it also requires openness. Rather than asking ourselves, "what academic programs and offerings would we like to provide?" or even "what programs does the market appear to want?" we have sought to tackle the challenge of strategic direction from the perspective of "what is the **job to be done** for emerging adults?"
        The outcome of this approach is the recognition that:
            The adult world has largely failed to provide emerging adults with a meaningful plan or strategy for connecting key questions of personal and moral development to the issue of work. 
The vast majority of Universities across North America are set-up to provide students with academic training in many different disciplines, but few have taken the much more demanding step of seeking to help students understand:
            a. who they are? and
            b. how is question of personal identity and values or beliefs, connected to the needs and opportunities in the world?
            c. where colleges and Universities do this well, they generally do so by focusing on either internships or on service-learning. 
            d. the very best example of a University that has made the focus on personal and career development a signature feature of the educational experience is Wake Forest University's Office for Personal and Career Development. 
        Wake Forest is truly excellent in this field, but as a once-faith-based University, it has not taken the step of connecting questions of personal identity and values to the biblical witness or person of Christ. This, I suggest, is a deficit that Trinity Western University address in systematic and meaningful ways. Doing so, however, would require us to reach back to Scripture and the Christian tradition for a vision of human flourishing and service grounded in the person and work of Christ. 
         
    In addition, students will need to have a support structure (i.e., a University that is committed, as a whole) to foster an iterative “experiential learning model” related to calling. 
    >”A program of purpose exploration is not the only way for campuses to accomplish this; but it is a demonstrably effective way to increase campus engagement and satisfaction, to focus attention beyond campus bubbles, and to supply a language, conversation partners, and generative resources that improve successful navigation of our highly competitive and complex world.” (205)
    In previous writing, I documented a pilot program that I launched to do this called the *Emmaus Scholars Program*. Some of that program can be retained and scaled up. Other elements will need to be added. 
    You can learn more about the *Emmaus Scholars Program* here: [“Nurturing Holy Grit”].
    The 2nd century theologian and bishop, Irenaeus rightly claimed the purpose and goal of human life was to be at peace with God. Human creatures have been created with a purpose and calling -- not to live for themselves, but to live for and with Christ. Irenaeus taught that “the glory of God is man fully alive" to which he adds, "man’s life is the vision of God" meaning, humanity is only truly alive when it sees and understands the world from the perspective of God's revelation in Christ, the One in whom we live and move and have our being (cf. Acts 17:28). 
        "...revealing God indeed to men, but presenting man to God, and
preserving at the same time the invisibility of the Father, lest man should at any time become a despiser of God, and that he should always possess something towards which he might advance; but, on the other hand, revealing God to men through many dispensations, lest man, failing away from God altogether, should cease to exist. **For the glory of God is a living man; and the life of man consists in beholding God. For if the manifestation of God which is made by means of the creation, affords life to all living in the earth, much more does that revelation of the Father which comes through the Word, give life to those who see God.** 
            Source: Irenaeus of Lyons, __Irenæus against Heresies,__ in __The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus__, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe, vol. 1, The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Company, 1885), 489–490.

n order to provide a satisfying answer to the questions: Why do we exist, and how will we measure our success?


If we were to try to express Irenaeus's claim in more contemporary language, we might say: "The glory of God is humanity fully alive."


    **Mission Statement**
        "The mission of Trinity Western University, as an arm of the Church, is to develop godly Christian leaders: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

        Note: if you look carefully at the syntax or grammatical structure of this sentence you notice, a clause and a colon.
        "^^The mission of Trinity Western University^^, as an arm of the Church, ^^is to develop godly Christian leaders^^: positive, goal-oriented university graduates with thoroughly Christian minds; growing disciples of Jesus Christ who glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission, serving God and people in the various marketplaces of life." 

            In a sense, the actual mission of TWU is ^^to develop godly Christian leaders^^.
                everything else serves to develop what we mean by "godly Christian leaders".
    **Why do we need a Vision Statement?**
        What: our current mission states **what** Trinity Western University does.
            **What does Trinity Western University do?**
            Answer: ^^develop godly Christian leaders^^.
            Others may question or seek to replace this mission with something else -- in order to shift the strategic direction of the university to pursue some other goal, but **this** is what we have committed ourselves to do. **Developing godly Christian leaders is why Trinity Western University exists**.
            It does not adequately express **why** we do this.
        However, there are two related questions that follow from this observation?
            ^^What will happen in the world if we are successful in carrying out this mission?^^ and
            ^^How will the world be better because Trinity Western University was faithful in carrying out its distinctly Christian calling and mission as a global Christian University?^^
        
    **What could a VISION STATEMENT** accomplish?
        Imaginative Challenge:
            Imagine if 30,000 TWU alumni had been formed by the very best of a TWU education -- how would the world be different? what impact would TWU have upon the world?
            
    **What Problem (Job to be done) does our Vision Statement need to solve/address?**
        What is the **Job to be done** for...
        1. STUDENTS?
            What struggle are they experiencing in their lives?
                1. who they are
                2. what they believe
                3. what to do in the world
        2. (the) WORLD?
            What struggle(s) is the world experiencing?
                1. navigating cultural, ethnic, religious __differences__?
                2. navigating the __dissolution__ of intellectual/moral consensus on what is true and good: with the consequence of tribalism and suspicion of the "other".
                3. no agreed-upon vision of human identity or flourishing (beyond consumption and comfort) 
            3. (the) TRIUNE GOD?
                1. has God clearly revealed his purpose for the world and Trinity Western University?
                2. do we offer the world a compelling and true witness of God's  we actively pursuing God's justice, reconciliation, and truth in the world?
                3. are we  we understand God's redemptive purposes for the world?
        for the world: 


2 Corinthians 5:14–21 (ESV)
14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; 
15 and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. 
16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. 
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 
18 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; 
19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 
20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
If we lack unity in carrying out our stated mission with the goal of achieving our new vision, Trinity Western University will not reach its potential.
We need to be willing to ask ourselves a very pointed series of questions: 
    a. why are we here?
    b. how might the triune God use and bless our efforts?
    c. what is God's measure of __success__?
    d. who, or what, is central to our work?
    e. where are we heading?
