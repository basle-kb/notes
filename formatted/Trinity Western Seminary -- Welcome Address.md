## New Student Orientation

Hello, my name is Dr. Mark Husbands, and I am privileged to serve as the President of Trinity Western University, and Trinity Western Seminary. 

It is a joy to offer you a warm and heartfelt welcome to Trinity Western and to ACTS seminaries. 
Together we share a mission to "educate, form, and equip you for service to God and the church."
We believe that God has called each of you to grow in your ability to minister the good news of the Gospel and the promise of hope, healing, and renewal wherever God sends you.
This is a high calling indeed, and we are thrilled to play a vital role in your preparation to serve God. 
I invite you to be open this year:
- open to God's call upon your life;
- open to finding your identity, purpose, and meaning within the drama of God's Word; and
- open to learning how to carry the Good news of the Gospel to all who are broken, vulnerable, and in need of forgiveness and healing;
- and finally, be open to finding joy, peace, and love as you learn in community. 

Welcome to Trinity Western Seminary! We are praying that you will have a fantastic year together at Trinity Western University and Seminary.
