- My response took the following form: 
- Dear Allan, Clarice, Tom, and Lorraine,
- I note that you copied me on an email earlier today. I will, of course, let Paul follow up — as ought to be the case.
- At the same time, please know that you are all in my prayers. So much so, that I felt led to write to you.
- I continue to pray that each of you will experience God’s grace and leading. I can’t imagine how you feel in light of this extracted issue with the elevator.  I can imagine that you are profoundly disappointed. Please know that I share your disappointment and will continue to work to make things right.
- On a rather different note, I thought that you might wish to know that I am busy writing an address (a kind of small sermon) for the entire TWU community — to be recorded on Friday. As I write, I feel duty bound to attempt to provide faculty and staff — all of whom begin a new semester quite worried about the future, and nervous not only about health issues, but about personal issues of security, loneliness, fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Yes, this is a challenging season for everyone.
- As a token of friendship and recognition of your love for TWU, I thought that you might appreciate seeing a portion of my “work in progress” (i.e., preparations for a talk that I will record later this week for an event on Monday.

- I am working on the following idea: when it comes to COVID-19, health offices around the world chart infections and deaths. __I wonder, however, if the greater impact of COVID-19 upon our society is not death but vulnerability__. In the face of such dramatic social and economic change, many, I suspect — in the depth of their hearts — are asking “why?”
    - Why has my life changed so very much?
    - Why am I cut off from my friends?
    - Why have I lost so very much,
    - Why am I not permitted to gather with all whom I love? And
    - why, am I lonely?
- These are all challenging questions. And when a vaccine remains no more than a distant hope on the horizon, these questions, I suspect, only grow in intensity.
- As someone raised in the Pentecostal church, I know firsthand the importance of praying for and relying upon the anointing of the Holy Spirit. I know that without the Spirit, we simply cannot fully or adequately experience the comfort, strength, leading, and blessing of God. As I write and trust in the leading of the Spirit, I am moved to reflect (for the entire TWU community) on the words of Psalm 91:1-2):
- 1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
-  will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
-  2 They say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
-  my God, in whom I trust.”
- When coupled with Hebrews 12:1b-2, “And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith” a striking picture begins to emerge:  The awakening of trust in God, the one who is indeed our only true refuge and fortress, rests in Jesus Christ, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. The Son of God trusted in his Heavenly Father, even to the point of death: and having been raised from the dead by the Spirit, He is now our refuge and fortress.
- I fear that there may be some at TWU who will, perhaps out of cold-heartedness, or a lack of genuine faith,  ignore or dismiss this appeal — an appeal to place our hope and trust in Christ — but perhaps, by God’s grace, others will not. You see, I know that this fall is a season shrouded in uncertainty:  we may begin the semester in earnest, and yet, in spite of all of our health and safety protocols and precautions, a significant COVID-19 outbreak may occur. We may even find ourselves closing down campus, and sending students home. God may place a hedge of protection around us — and we certainly pray for this — but God may also permit us to be as vulnerable as everyone else. All that we can do is to use our best judgement in preparing for and seeking to protect the health and safety of everyone involved, AND, at the same time, fervently pray for God’s protection. To pray that God will cover us with “his feathers” so that “under his wings” we “will find refuge” Psalm 91:4 (TNIV).
- We do pray this earnestly — and I will call everyone at TWU to do so. Even if, as is likely the case, several people do contract COVID-19, we will need to trust, and remind ourselves that “his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart” (Psalm 91:4)
- I find great comfort in the knowledge that God so deeply loves us that he wanted us to hear the words of comfort spoken in Psalm 91. The God in whom we believe, not only calls us to obey — to cast all of our cares upon him — but to trust. Each of us is called to trust in the Word of God: Jesus Christ, Lord over all. For it is here, and only here, where human opinions, speculation, biases, and prejudice, have no quarter. Only here, stands truth, grace, and love. God calls each of us, in the midst of our fear, loneliness, anxiety, and vulnerability, to dwell “in the shelter of the Most High” to “rest in the shadow of the Almighty” and to speak openly of Christ, saying “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust” (Psalm 91:2)

- Allan, Clarice, Tom, and Lorraine, please know that you are in my prayers: I continue to pray that each of you will find rest in the shadow the most high, and that you be given a powerful sense the peace, comfort, and blessing of the Spirit.
- Warmly,
- Mark
