    - Universities will have to change, of course 
    - But the shared, in-person experience will always have a place in education. The question is: what is that place? How will our evolving view of education “delivery” be combined with other things that make “going to college” so attractive?. 
    - But sharing a learning experience in a group, and then discussing it, is an experience many students will still seek out, and support 
    - Building 1. The Clock Tower 
    - Some experiences are more intense, more vivid, and more memorable for being shared 
    - Yes, suppressing the tower’s tyranny illustrates the attraction of asynchronous instruction, but if we also want shared experience we’ll need schedules. The clock tower stays 
    - 2. The Stadium 
    - The central tower peals out the time; coordination is better than anarchy. But saying, “Education will occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 11:10 and 12:25, and at no other time,” is artificial 
    - Many faculty lament the importance of college athletics. But humans are tribal; people like belonging. Connecting intellectual and team identities bundles a range of shared connections, and it’s no accident that successful athletic programs can make the difference between survival and stagnation. 
    - 3. The Student Union 
    - Every club has leadership and service positions. These connections are much deeper, and more valuable, than the dismissive “social life” description they are given 
    - groups provide invaluable opportunities for connections, experimentation, and growing up. Having to deal with people you didn’t choose as friends, and navigating relationships with people you want to know as more than friends, is part of maturity 
    - 4. The Admissions Office 
    - the “signal” of graduating from an elite college is valuable. The graduate combines intellect, compliance to rules, the ability to complete tasks, and at least the rudiments of time management skills. Leading into the college experience, the admissions process is itself a signal that the graduate was examined closely in complicated, multi-dimensional competition 
    - Attracting students to a bricks-and-mortar campus requires a mix, or bundle, of services that cannot be easily replicated, even piecemeal, and which nowhere are available as a bundle with such convenience. 
    - the difficulty young people have adjusting to growing up on their own in an increasingly complex world. That is not a problem that colleges created, but a concentrated on-campus experience is still the solution. 
    - the experience of college students is multiplicative and synergistic: a college is not the sum of the four buildings, but their product.
