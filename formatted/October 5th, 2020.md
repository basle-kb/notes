- #[V.P. of Philanthropy](<V.P. of Philanthropy.md>) of Philanthropy Discussion [October 5th, 2020](<October 5th, 2020.md>)
    - **Discussion**
    - 
    - **Let me be perfectly clear:**
    - 
^^I want Paul Weme to flourish at TWU -- in now way is any of the following evidence of, or grounds for "constructive dismissal"^^
    - ^^The departure of Paul Weme from TWU, after 20 years of employment, would be regrettable and it is, in my view, entirely possible for Paul to retire sometime down the road with TWU's praise and genuine gratitude for a fruitful career of significant service and effort on behalf of the mission, ideals, and goals of the University. Anything less than this would be a shame.^^
    - 
Opening Question:
        - Why is it important to you to have a new position description?
            - search names are reaching out to me to : Larry Nelson (Nelson and & Craft)
            - LinkedIn
                - donors?
                    - "I thought you you were the V.P. of Development
                    - Harry Gross, Lethbridge
                    - Shirley Theissen
                    - Bob Raalston
                    - Rochelle (staff members)
                    - 
        - What do you want out of your job at Trinity?
            - 
        - In all that you have asked for, what is the most important thing?
            - 
        - What for you is a "deal breaker" and why is this case?
        - Do you believe that the University has actually carried out measures that constitute "constructive dismissal" 
        - Do you want to leave the University?
            - I come across as "this is my donor" not the University's donor
            - i have been criticized for being selfish
    - ^^Action Steps^^
        - Agree on the terms of this job description
        - 
    - **However** 
        - Paul has not made the past number of years easy -- in fact, there have been instances of behaviour which have demonstrated a lack of professional judgement and competence. This has been very frustrating and difficult to support.  
        - Significant changes need to occur for Paul to truly flourish here in a way that ensures that he is both respected and valued.
            - Failure to write clearly, think strategically, maintain confidence, and demonstrate an ability to collaborate and support initiatives without undue "drama" have contributed to the need for me to set out the terms of a job description that Paul has asked for, but did not anticipate would take the form that it has. 
    - The President has written a job description that states the following: 
        - **Position Purpose and**** ****Summary**
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2F7tKPEDLJ9G.png?alt=media&token=c94ded61-aa4e-4fd7-98ee-480564108728)
                - The President did not ask you for a job description, nor invite you to submit one. However, on your own accord you did so:
                    - - without taking the efforts to discuss these matters in detail with the President prior to submitting your unsolicited draft, you have written:
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2FZVtGyquqwQ.png?alt=media&token=df0b7085-1808-443f-827c-a9768570d0b5)
                            - I. Comment
                                - In light of challenges in the past, there will be no dual-reporting structure in this case. You will report to the V.P. of Development.
                                - I am unprepared to have you act independently of the President or V.P. of Development. In fact, I will need to see a dramatically increased ability to work collaboratively, build trust, properly document your work, and support the efforts of Development without casting blame on others. 
                                - You will not serve on the U.L.C. -- the V.P. of Development will. 
                                - You will be expected to work collaboratively with the President and the V.P. of Development: we should discuss the matter of "collaboration" carefully.
                                -  
        - **Fundraising strategy**
            - The President has written the following:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2F4IfNYu2QyP.png?alt=media&token=0816c89c-4d0a-446c-b672-58ee61ac1bd3)
            - Consequently:
                - you will be expected to work closely with the President and V.P. of Development
                - you will be expected to carry out specific duties on projects as needed (particularly during the interim period without a V.P. of Development)
                - you are not being invited to take the lead in building or nurturing the relationship with the Township of Langley. You are being invited to support these efforts.
        - **Constituent Networks**
            - The President has written the following:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2FJTGbxhxRGF.png?alt=media&token=72f40748-0419-45d7-be08-8f43adc540d7)
                - One of the problems with your draft job description and my own is this: 
                    - It is expected that you will "build relationships with both internal and external constituents..."
                        - when you:
                            - fail to act in a professional manner
                            - fail to write and think clearly, effectively, accurately, and
                            - do not take the efforts to clearly think through what you need prior to asking, and sometimes demanding, others to serve your needs, you actually frustrate those around you and make it all the harder for internal offices -- such as the President's office, MarComm, and Institutional Research to want to work with you. 
                            - In short, you have been ineffective in "building relationships internally" with the result that the development team does not have the internal support that it could otherwise have gained. 
                    - Thus, I have italicized the word "collaboratively" -- you will need to take serious effort to improve in this area if you seek to flourish in this position and seek to improve rather than diminish the work and reputation of the Development team internally and perhaps externally.
                    - You have not demonstrated a strong ability to work collaboratively and professionally with others across the University, nor have you demonstrated an ability to effectively lead and manage others. **This is a point of significant frustration for the President because the University needs V.P.'s who can truly build trust, respect, and carry-out work in a demonstrably collaborative and supportive fashion. **
                    - As a result, I cannot support your desire to have an elevated and strategic role in Senior Administration (see below):
            - **Senior Administration**
                - You have written:
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2FsbXqdtPcmt.png?alt=media&token=34b15d15-21c6-4bd5-856a-5c7ceedc609c)
                - However, issues noted above, and more, make it exceedingly difficult to have you serve in a Senior leadership position. 
                - I recommend that you find concrete ways to derive meaning, value, purpose, and calling from excelling in fundraising with principal donors and allow strategic management responsibilities to rest with a V.P. of Development. You are valued, but not for the latter. 
            - **Skills and Abilities**
                - The President has written the following:
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fchurchdogmatics%2FZasZ3kQPsE.png?alt=media&token=7cb4041a-ff07-4f95-bfbb-56852e1f8dd7)
                - Your list of Skills and Abilities is not in agreement with mine.
                    - You appear to believe that you are being asked to take the lead in:
                        - visioning, leadership, change management, analysis, decision-making, effective communication, collaboration, being a "team player", and institutional understanding. 
                    - However, I have clearly identified a set of skills and abilities that I need you to either acquire or develop.
                        - Note: you are not being asked to take a lead role in:
                            - visioning
                            - leadership
                            - change management
                            - analysis
                            - or effective communication
                        - While I would like you to be able to do these things, you have demonstrated an inability to do so:
                            -  you have not shown an ability to demonstrate effective leadership, or effective communication in written form
                            - you have not demonstrated an ability to be a "team player", nor have you shown an awareness of how your actions, and the actions of your team, have been so frustrating for others.
