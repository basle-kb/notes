Sample Text for **Invitation **to provide a lecture
    - Dear Han-luen,
    - I hope that you and your entire family are doing well in the midst of all of the challenges of COVID-19 and a new semester.
    - I am happy to report that things are going well where and that enrolment challenges due to COVID-19 did not materialize. People across campus worked tremendously hard and students appear to be adjusting. 
    - I wonder if you would be be so kind as to look over your schedule for September 24 to see if you happen to be free between 1:30 to 2:45pm PST. 
    - The reason I ask is that I have launched a new faculty faith and learning program and throughout the year, we hold a seminar (really a presentation with an assigned reading), for 13 new faculty (including 1 new Dean of Natural Sciences). 
    - One of the most interesting things about being here is the recognition that the vast majority of faculty are committed to Christ and while seeking to model for students what a mature disciple looks like, it is evident that no one has asked them to work on connecting their Christian faith to their teaching and scholarship. Of course, this is not ideal. In order to address this, I began running a 8 month faculty faith and learning program with the goals of:
        - - fostering a shared theological literacy among all faculty members. 
        - - introducing faculty to key theological categories and knowledge that could help them to more adequately model and share what it means to find a deep and abiding joy in discovering the coherence of a world sustained by a gracious and loving God.
        - - encourage the discovery and pursuit of the distinct calling and work of a Christian professor; one that issues in the call to offer students a compelling and wonderful expression of what it means to love God with one’s heart, soul, strength, and mind (Luke 10:27).[*](((v_TmmCg0Z))) {{[r/moved](<r/moved.md>)}}
        - - enable faculty to and faith deliver on a promise that Trinity Western University has made to parents, students, and our broader Christian community: namely, (according to the 2012 Senate approved [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/sites/default/files/assets/2012-11-twu-slo.pdf), that "Trinity Western University’s distinctive approach to education is one in which, as a “Christian, liberal arts University, Trinity Western is grounded in the historical Christian tradition and seeks to unite reason and faith through teaching and scholarship.”
        -   
        - As a liberal arts university, Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity,
diversity, and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world and helping them to
develop transferable intellectual and practical skills.

    - Dear Han-luen,
    - hings are going well here, in spite of the threat to enrolment posed by COVID-19,, due to remarkable work on the part of countless individuals across campus, 
    - I hope that you, David, and Kenneth are doing well in the midst of all of the challenges of COVID-19 and a new semester.I am happy to report that things are going well where and that enrolment challenges due to COVID-19 did not materialize. People across campus worked tremendously hard and students appear to be adjusting.
    - I am writing to see if your schedule on September 24th would permit you to offer a Faculty Faith and Learning lecture (for new TWU faculty) on the topic of **Nicene Orthodoxy**. 
        - A little background on what the new cohort of faculty have learned, and what they are schedule to encounter might help. 
        - Early in August, in the course of a week-long new faculty orientation, we covered the following:

            - One last element: Each of the faculty have been given a copy of Robert Wilken's __The Spirit of Early Christian Thought__. I have not yet "assigned" a reading for the September 24 session, but if I was to select a chapter from Wilken's lovely book, I would likely choose [Chapter 5: "Not my will but Thine"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yfwzpuamcp1lo7e/Wilken%20-%20Chapter%205%20-%20Not%20my%20will%20but%20Thine.pdf?dl=0).
            - 
All to say, I would love to invite you to lead the September 24 faculty "faith & learning seminar". 
                - I would, of course, offer you a modest honorarium of $250 USD, and we would have you present via Zoom. 
            - While it would be lovely to have you involved in the seminar, if your schedule or research does not permit you to lead this session, I hope that you will consider being open to doing so sometime in the future.

    - I am writing to invite you to lead a faculty faith and learning seminar over Zoom. The timing might not work for you — which I completely understand, but if it does, and you feel that it would be too great a burden to prepare for this, it would be lovely to have you introduce a small cohort of new TWU faculty to the topic of “Nicene Orthodoxy”.

    - How does all of this sound?

The good news about our time zone difference is that our Faculty Faith and Learning seminar would be in the afternoon. The bad news, it seems, is that it 1:30-2:30 our time, is 3:30-4:30 your time.



As for the format: it can be quite flexible, especially given the zoom distance mode.
    - Ideally, if there is something for them to read in advance that would be good.
    - Of course, they are all new faculty and likely quite burdened with day to day course planning, but it is still reasonable (hence my suggestion of [Chapter 5: "Not my will but Thine”](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yfwzpuamcp1lo7e/Wilken%20-%20Chapter%205%20-%20Not%20my%20will%20but%20Thine.pdf?dl=0))
    - More importantly however is this:
        - Bearing in mind that this group of faculty did not have an undergraduate experience like yours, they are (like most faculty at CCCU institutions) a bit lost and perhaps even a bit nervous about “faith integration” and they certainly don’t quite know how the content of faith intersects with their own teaching area or research.
        - Thus the seminar.
        - That said: if you were to consider preparing a “talk” that would cover the following for non-specialists:
            - Briefly introduce yourself, your current position, and research interests
            - Briefly - what happened at Nicaea and why might this be important for us (as the Contemporary Church)
            - What two or three key statements of the Patristic period help us to grasp why belief in divinity (and humanity) of Jesus is crucial?
                - Perhaps:
                    - “We see plainly the twofold state (status), which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person—Jesus, God and Man” (Tertullian, “Against Praxeas” chap. 27, ANF 3, 624.)
                    - “If we call him who was born of Mary, and who was crucified, a man, then we make him a man instead of God. And in a man the life which is given by God cannot be found.”  (cited in, H. Lietzman, Appolinaris von Laodicea und seine Schule, “Texte und Untersuchungen,” No. 1. (Tübingen: Mohr, 1904), 202. ),
                    - "For that which He [the Son] has not assumed He has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half of Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.” (Gregory of Nazianzus, Epistle NPNF2 7)
            - It would also be helpful, I think, for you to lay out why (i.e., the foundational source(s) of authority for the Early Church) they took the step of agreeing upon a Creed (and what was the role of Scripture in all of this).
        - As you can see: pretty basic and foundational stuff, but essential I think, to helping them begin to gain confidence in the intellectual tradition and shape of a Christian Mind.
If you are not able to take this, please feel entirely free to say so: my sense is that this is all material that you have close at hand, and that they will be encouraged by your remarkable combination of warmth, intelligence, and faith (high, but deserving praise, I know).
Grace and peace,

## Outline of Key Elements of the [Faculty Faith & Learning Program](<Faculty Faith & Learning Program.md>)
    - Not only will the program orient you to the high
calling of being a Christian University Professor, it also prepares you to
deliver on a promise that Trinity Western University has made to parents,
students, and our broader Christian community. On November 6, 2012, the TWU
Senate approved, for the first time, a formal statement of 
    - [Student Learning Outcomes](<Student Learning Outcomes.md>)
        - [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/sites/default/files/assets/2012-11-twu-slo.pdf). 
            - This statement represents the completion of three years of work in response to the BC Ministry of Advanced Education. The February 12, 2013 announcement indicates:
                - “Senate's work articulates Student Outcomes that give faculty clear program and curricular priorities that are a common thread between every course and every department on campus. It gives students clear results they can measure, and incoming students a way to anticipate their experience of a TWU education." The opening sentences of this document clearly document Trinity Western University's distinctive approach to education:
                    - “Trinity Western is a Christian, liberal arts University. As a Christian
university, Trinity Western is grounded in the historical Christian tradition and seeks to unite reason and faith through teaching and scholarship.” (CUDrvnqeF)
    - The
reason for Trinity Western University to the calling of a Christian Professor
is to take up the laudable task of teaching the liberal arts in ways that
invite students to pursue friendship with God; a process in which God builds a
place for fellowship and truth in their very souls:
    - “Let
no man excuse himself. Let no man say, ‘I am not able to build a house for the
Lord ; my poverty does suffice for such an expensive project; I have no place
in which to build it.’… You shall build a house for the Lord out of your own
self. He himself will be the builder ; your heart will be the place ; your
thoughts will supply the material.”
    - —
Hugh of St. Victor
