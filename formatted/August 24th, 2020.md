    - "Reorganization of Enrolment Team"
    - >
    - Hello Ann,
    - Would Mark be available on Monday, Tuesday, or
Wednesday next week to meet about our draft structure plan?  I’ve worked
with the EM leadership team on a re-imagined structure in order to be ready for
recruitment in a COVID world and to reflect the scope of our division’s new
responsibilities.  I can send documents over the weekend for him to review
ahead of time.
    - About an hour would be great, if that’s possible.
