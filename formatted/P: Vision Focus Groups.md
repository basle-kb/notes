        - Notes from 9.9.20 Meeting:
            - Thank you for everyone’s time this morning to explore the framework and required deliverables for us to execute the Vision Tour well. Below are my notes...if helpful. Here is what I have as next steps.

            - TWU Vision Statement // 9.9.20
            - September 9, 2020
            - 8:05 AM
            - **ATTENDEES**
            - Dr. Mark Husbands, President
            - Naomi Lomavatu, Trinity Fellow
            - Winnie Lui, Director, PR
            - James Tweedy, Executive Director, Marketing & Communications
            - **PURPOSE**
            - The goal of this meeting is to determine the format, content and supporting roles of the team in creating the meeting materials that Dr. Husbands will guide invitees through during the ‘invitation to conversation’. Here is a proposed skeleton format of the engagement, a strawman to be refined and redrawn. We will aim to define the ‘deliverable’ for each area including roles and responsibilities.
            - **DISCUSSION POINTS**
            - **What is the reaction we want from the audience?**
            - We want them to see the opportunity to reimagine the value of a TWU education, we could prepare our students in an entirely new way, with a new focus—and articulate a vision that would guide us to do that
            - **MEETING FLOW / AGENDA**
            - **Introduction to Vision Statement (Context Setting) - Introducing the Problem**
            - "Life Doesn't Come with a Map" - it's an adventure, it's a journey - and we all face that problem regardless of that  Navigating Your Future -  Topographical Map illustration
            - __*FEEDBACK & DISCUSSION*__
            - TRANSITION: What role can (or how might) TWU play in solving this problem?
            - (our answer aka the punchline) TWU is the finest institution in Canada to navigate this problem
            - **THE 3 PROMPTS** - What are the 3 prompts that allow a general audience (with no background) to enter into exploring how a Christian University might play a role in answering this question? __(1-2m of set-up 8-10m discussion)__
            - **Design Thinking Issue** - Who You Are, What You Believe, What You Do (An Integrated Life)
            - Life as a Response (Calling) "Life isn't to be invented, it's to be discovered" / James 'Father of Lights'
            - **The Value of a Christian Education** (What role does a high-quality Christian education play in this?)
            - JDH pg. 202 "Most of us, however, need the reinforcement that social institutions provide to believe coherently and live with integrity."
            - "Knowing How To Make A Difference in the World" requires a high-quality Christian education, the means by which you connect who you are, what you believe and what value you can bring to the world (so you can make a contribution)
            - The example and modelling of deep and committed Christian adults (professors etc.)
            - We have more than knowledge transfer, we have people* that live fully integrated Christian lives and serve as catalysts for character formation. They can model for you how they've figured out how to live life well.
            - **Personal & Career Development** / Way-finding Outside of the Classroom, lead in for the creation of an Office of Personal & Career Development
            - **CONCLUSION / CONCLUDING REMARKS**
            - **"What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life." ~ Mary Oliver (Life/Purpose/Meaning)Exploring a purposeful life, what difference does it make to your life if you know your 'one wild and precious life' is a gift (James 1:17)**
            - **CALL TO ACTION**
            - **SURVEY RESPONSE - Typeform Survey - An opportunity to capture what you've experienced**
            - **We want to take these insights and observations back as we develop a vision statement**
            - **Pray for us during this season**
            - **WHAT IS THE ONE IDEA WE WANT EVERY ATTENDEE TO LEAVE WITH?**
            - **TWU is all about helping each student be career and life ready and do so as resilient disciples**
            - **That TWU cares about the well-being and flourishing of the city**
            - **VISION STATEMENT NOTES //**
            - Let's avoid "lazy" Christian language (ie. 'transformational impact on culture', 'Christ-like' = played out) let's explain/unpack what we mean
            - We have to articulate a vision statement that will be 'bilingual' or 'bicultural'
            - Why would we want to give you the skills and abilities to navigate well? Because your life is going to be significantly more meaningful if your life is offered back to God in the service of others for the flourishing of the city
            - __Footnote__
            - Salt & Light Concept as a lead-in - it's so common, people know we ought to be a witness - We know that Christ tells us we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world (Matthew 5:13-16)
