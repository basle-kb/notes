    - We may feel vulnerable to know that our very existence is contingent in every moment upon the will of God. But God’s being and character are changeless. With him there is no shadow of variation. Is there anything more reliable to stand upon?

If these things are true, then the first gift ever given is the simple grace that anything exists in the first place. Creation itself is the original witness to the generosity of God. The world only is because grace is.

Help us, O Lord, even in the midst of this time of anxiety and mortality, to remember that every moment we are is a moment when you will us to be. We thank you for the gift of this life, this day, and this hour. May we never take for granted the good and perfect gifts you give.
