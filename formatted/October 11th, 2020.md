    - 17﻿Every good and perfect gift is from above,﻿﻿ coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights,﻿﻿ who does not change﻿﻿ like shifting shadows. 18﻿He be chose to give us birth﻿﻿ through the word of truth,﻿﻿ that we might be a kind of firstfruits﻿﻿ of all he created.
    - Listening and Doing
    - 19﻿My dear brothers and sisters,﻿﻿ take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak﻿﻿ and slow to become angry, 20﻿because our anger﻿﻿ does not produce the righteousness that God desires. 21﻿Therefore, get rid of﻿﻿ all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you,﻿﻿ which can save you.
    - 22﻿Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.﻿﻿ 23﻿Those who listen to the word but do not do what it says are like people who look at their faces in a mirror 24﻿and, after looking at themselves, go away and

    - 26﻿Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues﻿﻿ deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. 27﻿Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after﻿﻿ orphans and widows﻿﻿ in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.﻿﻿
