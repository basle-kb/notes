    - JOHN WEBSTER  That was what was done, It was done not by us, but by God himself in the person of his Servant and Son, And it was done by God alone. Because reconciliation is thus God's work, God's exclusive work, then this saerament in which we remember the eross of Christ is also God's work. Here, in this assembly at this table, God is at work. And God's work here is to present to us, to make present to us, what took place on Good Priday, We don't make Good Friday real by re-enacting it, or by thinking and feeling about it. God in this sacrament declares to us what Good Friday made true: that he is our reconeiler; that sin is finished business; that we can repent because God has forgiven; that the promise acted out in the death of Jesus stands for all time and for each human person. In this memorial, God turns us backward; but he also makes present to us the limitless power of what the Son of God suffered, The God who was at work there And then is at work here and now, proclaiming to us his promise of eleansing, acceptance and peace.
