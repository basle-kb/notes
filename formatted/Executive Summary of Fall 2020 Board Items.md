- BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION & FINANCES
    - Under the direction of Aklilu Mulat (Senior Vice President of
Business Administration and CFO), have done an exemplary job of responding to the challenge of COVID-19 with with discipline, care, and efficacy. The negative financial impacts of COVID-19 would have been significant had Aklilu and his team failed to navigate these challenges as effectively as they have.
    - Financial Services engaged in a number of initiatives of which the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) primary. This has resulted in a subsidy of $4.9 mil for the period of April – June.  
    - Financial Services pivoted quickly to provide remote processing 
    - IT has been central in the development of new multi-access technology, implementation of VPN service for international students, improving the single-sign system for students, campus connectivity between Langley and Richmond, improved cellular signal at the Minoru campus, improved service management systems, improved access of student photos for teaching and learning, and full deployment of Microsoft Teams for teaching and learning.
    - TWU Ancillaries consisting of housing, dining, conferencing and TW Outfitters (bookstore) have been severely affected by the pandemic. Summer conferencing revenue, which was budgeted to be $860K was reduced to $9K due to cancellations. We are budgeting a revenue reduction of 50% from the originally budgeted amount for dining and housing due to the restricted residency capacity.
    - Preparations for fall return of students included extensive work by maintenance and custodial staff.  In particular, preparation and organization for quarantined students was managed well. Significant lighting upgrades have been made throughout campus improving accessibility and safety while reducing costs related to utilities. The team has implemented Pay-by-Phone parking, installed a fire alarm system at Mattson Centre, negotiated with Translink to bring bus service to campus, built a bus stop and improved and built several sidewalks.  In addition, the team has completed fire alarm upgrades in Fraser Hall, library basement renovations, Music Building upgrades and Trinity Commons renovation. 
    - The efforts of the Business Administration team have been focused
on enabling TWU departments to accomplish their respective goals in the midst of disruption due to COVID-19.  To this end, staff members have demonstrated both understanding and commitment to the university’s mission.
    - 
- DEVELOPMENT
    - Our ability to continue to serve our growing student body depends upon our ability to sustain and nurture new partnerships
with donors. In the absence of an effective leader in the area of Development, the President has addressed the lack of clear strategy and accountability by:
    - (1) developing and implementing a new Donor Cultivation and Recognition Process; 
    - (2) launched a national search for a new Vice President of
Development; while 
    - (3) transitioning an existing V.P. of Development to a new
position: V.P. of Philanthropy (Principal Gifts). 
    - Key to the future success of the Development office will be the acquisition of a V.P. of Development with exceptional communication, leadership, and management skills, and an ability to negotiate across a diversity of cultures, and high emotional intelligence, with a proven track record of innovative and strategic fundraising efforts.

- ENROLMENT
    - In March, during the peak of the recruitment cycle, the planet
went into lockdown. Our ability to meet with families, visit high schools, run
Preview events, as well as most every other recruitment activity abruptly
ended. Current students were sent home and classes moved online, not affording
us the benefit of properly bringing the semester to a close before students
scattered around the world. For many families, the financial reality of
COVID-19 began to set in and we started to receive requests for re-evaluations
of financial aid packages and inquiries about deferral of studies. It was clear
that the March-September enrolment season would be unlike any other. To be
successful, we would need to focus on 3 key elements: __recruitment, retention, __and__ access__.
    - As our Enrolment and TWU GLOBAL teams continued to focus on recruitment, a team of 50+ staff and faculty from most every department on campus came together to focus on retention. For the first time, incoming and current students were served within one CRM platform, allowing for access to data from a variety of a departments to be brought together for the collective task of retention. While enrolment was being secured by recruitment and retention efforts, 12 interdepartmental task forces worked to create TWU Access, allowing students to access the TWU experience from anywhere in the world.
    - Because the Trinity Western community came together to focus
on recruitment, retention, and access, we were able to welcome the largest student body in the history of TWU. Fall 2020 enrolment is 4,774 students, up from 4,476 in 2019. Overall university enrolment has increased 6.7% over last year.
    - In the wake of the departure of Scott Fehrenbacher, I have promoted (1) Brian Kerr to Senior Vice President of Enrolment, Personal and Career Development, and (2) Dr. Phil Laird, to the position of Chief Innovation Officer, Vice Provost of Global. Trinity Western University is blessed to have these remarkably talented individuals. Brian and Phil possess a truly exceptional depth of expertise, knowledge, social intelligence, and commitment to the mission of Trinity Western University.
    - Recruitment for 2021 cohorts has begun, albeit in a very different way than last year. Almost every element of recruitment has changed. Typically, at this time year, each member of our recruitment team is on the road. They would often visit 3 high schools per day, take part in large college fairs, meet in-person with a prospective student and their parents, and host countless visitors on-campus for tours and appointments.  __This year__, high schools are closed to outside visitors, college fairs are virtual, and in-person campus visits must be done with strict COVID-19 protocols in place.
    - In order to meet the challenges of this rapidly evolving landscape, we have restructured our Enrolment Management Department. The timing, pace, and virtual nature of events will require a more agile and adaptable team.
    - In September 2020, as the former External Relations division was reorganized, a new collection of departments was brought together. Under the umbrella of Enrolment, Personal & Career Development (EPCD), the existing Enrolment Management team is now connected to Parent Engagement and TWU Alumni. Over the coming year, the Office of Personal and Career Development will be added into the mix, allowing for a fully-integrated focus on the student journey. 
    - Although still in the design phase, the creation of the Office of Personal & Career Development represents one of the greatest opportunities that TWU has to increase value proposition and to advance its mission and vision. There is no doubt that Trinity Western’s mission is vital to the wellbeing of Canada and the world.  Each year, hundreds of graduates earn degrees from TWU. While many students navigate this journey well, gaining the skills and convictions that we hoped for them, some fall short of realizing the true potential of a Trinity Western education. As the nature of the student body continues to grow in diversity, in terms of cultures, campus locations, ages of students, and level of study, it is critical that we ensure a coordinated effort as we prepare students to live out the mission of Trinity Western University.

- HEALTH & SAFETY
    - __But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. Isaiah 40:31a__
    - The remarkable Chair of the 23-member COVID-19 Health & Safety Task Force, Dr. Sonya Grypma, worked shoulder-to-shoulder with exceptionally gifted and committed colleagues, who together helped to develop the comprehensive [**TWU COVID-19 Safety Plan**](https://www.twu.ca/sites/default/files/public_covid-19_health_safety_plan_aug2020.pdf) published in August 2020.
    - On May 7, 2020, the day after the BC Restart Plan was published, we launched a series of task forces to help prepare for Fall 2020. One of these was the Health & Safety Task Force. Building on work done since January 2020 by the TWU COVID-19 Response team, members of this task force met almost daily between May and August with the following mandate: “**To provide clear direction to TWU leaders regarding how to safely re-open and run TWU campuses in a way that reduces the spread of COVID-19.” **
    - We have transitioned our efforts from planning to operations, via the establishment of a COVID-19 Public Health Team. This team is comprised of a newly-hired Public Health Lead, Taryne Lepp, the Director of the Wellness Centre Michele Regehr, and a number of newly-hired public health nurses working for us on a contracted basis. Under the direction of Sonya Grypma as Senior Health Advisor, the Public Health Team aims to safely maximize all TWU in-person experiences. We have done this through the development of protocols and processes that have, to date, allowed for the safe return to campus of 650 residential students, and the provision of face-to-face courses for 10% of regular TWU courses (based on our current headcount of 5500 students, this involves approximately 550 students). In addition, we have developed processes and materials for COVID-19 communication, leader training, digital solutions for daily self-assessment and campus logins, and a sophisticated approval process for all in-person programs, activities, and events.
    - TWU is well prepared to safely support our students, faculty, and staff through this global pandemic. In addition to the above, we are well prepared to support testing, contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine as necessary. Although we anticipate and are prepared for COVID transmission within our TWU population, we are grateful to the Lord that, to date, we have had no COVID-19 positive student cases.
- 
- MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS
    - James Tweedy is providing a high-level of professional and cost-effective leadership to the marketing and communications team. Within surrounding the ever-evolving COVID-19 global pandemic has proven to be a significant, yet exciting, challenge. The mandate of the Communications Task Force, “to create a confidence building communications strategy around (the University’s) ability to meet the challenge of COVID-19” effectively captures the driving focus for communications efforts during this season.
    - The narrative has moved from finishing well in the spring—moving classes online, TWU Live and graduation celebrations—to pivoting well—team-of-teams launch, the Journey Forward and Core Team activation—to ultimately reimagining the delivery of the Trinity Western University distinctive and confidently communicating it within the challenging environment of an active global pandemic.
    - Although our recent enrolment and re-enrolment numbers are certainly an encouragement and a testament of God’s faithfulness, the true win lies in the University’s ability to shift the focus from the present, to the future, by casting an inspiring and compelling vision that clearly articulates our positive impact upon the world.
    - Here is an excellent sample of how we strove to build confidence in the value of a Trinity Western University education amidst COVID-19. We made extensive use of video with the goal of highlighting the claim: "The world has changed. Your future hasn't" [cf. TWU Access Video](https://vimeo.com/445713063).
    - Addressing the fundamental concerns of students and parents in Phase 1 laid the necessary foundation to build out a more virtual student experience and a robust explanation and overview to orient (and re-orient) all students to the ‘new’ student experience at Trinity Western University—whether an incoming student or fourth year.
    - The driving question of this exercise was, “where do students show up on Day 1 of fall?” An orientation team, with participants from Marketing and Communications, were labouring to conceive an entirely new Orientation Day (O-Day) experience. But, what about the week after O-Week? As key contributors to the sub-task force of the Virtual Campus Task Force, led by Richard Taylor, the Marketing and Communications team was able to conceive and deliver two primary answers to this question—a new student experience portal and a new app.
    - These efforts resulted in the categorization of our primary product and service offerings surrounding student life at TWU being: Courses (Academics), Community (Student Life & Events) and Services (Academic & Support). Simple overview videos—hosted by Jassie Virk (Youth Alpha)—explain and introduce these different areas to orient both incoming and returning students successfully.

- PROVOST
    - Over the past several months, faculty professional learning initiatives have focused exclusively on how to teach effectively online. The Multi-access Task Force, comprised of faculty representatives from each School and Faculty, as well as three Student Life representatives and the Executive Director of Online Learning, led the initiative with its purpose: “to ensure that TWU faculty have the necessary knowledge, resources, and support to plan and teach multi-access courses for the 2020-21 academic year.” Over the past six months the GLOBAL Online teams:
        - •	Developed Teaching Online Effectively (TOnE) mini-course in which over 200 faculty members participated in online education to shift their courses to multi-access modalities for the delivery of over 1500 Fall courses.
        - •	Supervised the training of Facilitators and participated in the design of Learning Labs impacting over 650 students.
        - •	Launched Fall bi-weekly TOnE Swap Meet sessions whereby faculty share promising tech practices and learn about emerging technologies thus continuing to nurture and enhance TWU’s ability to deliver high a quality and experiential learning for all students.
    - A key initiative arising from the Office of Teaching and Learning is the first-year cohort course bundle for incoming traditional undergraduate students. Three courses in the core curriculum that fulfill degree requirements for all of these students were deliberately designed to integrate with one another, hence the term “bundle.” Instructional designers worked with faculty to move Foundations 101, Philosophy 105, and whatever Writing or English course a student is placed in (Writing 100/101/English 103) into online platforms. The Office of the Registrar placed every incoming student into a course bundle of about 15 students each. The bundle introduces first-year students to the purpose, strength, and beauty of a Christian liberal arts university education by explicitly pointing out interconnections between these courses.
    - In addition to the above, Dr. Laurie Matthias has given leadership to other responsibilities in her role as Associate Provost Teaching and Learning. Thirteen new full-time faculty were welcomed into the TWU community in August. In cooperation with President Husbands, the Associate Provost Teaching and Learning implemented a new five-day format for New Faculty Orientation with a primary focus on the integration of faith and learning. Monthly Faith and Learning seminars for these new faculty members will continue throughout the academic year.
    - The Executive Director of the Learning Commons Jenn Skelding transitioned to her new position as a faculty member in the School of Education in July. In order to fill the leadership gap for 2020-21, Laurie is providing general oversight while two current staff members in the Learning Commons have taken on additional responsibilities.
    - Dr. Eve Stringham completed her time at TWU this summer and took an administrative role at another university in B.C.  During her tenure, we have seen significant growth in research funding and capacity. Due to the financial challenges that we are facing, the decision was made to hold off filling Eve’s position this year.  Dr. Richard Chandra has taken on additional responsibilities in the area of Research, working with Provost Wood, while Dr. Sonya Grypma is leading the Graduate Studies portfolio.
    - ^^Add in research funding chart and summary of awards^^
    - 2020 has marked an incredible year of transformation and growth in TWU GLOBAL. The restructuring from TWU Extension to TWU GLOBAL in mid-2019 has proven to very timely, as the appointments of Dr. Sonya Grypma and Scott Macklin to lead in academic quality assurance and online learning, respectively. Little did we know that God had set in place key leadership that would strengthen the University through the worldwide pandemic. Although we were filling roles and assigning responsibilities, God was preparing a firm foundation by providing expertise in public health leadership and distributed, multi-access education that would prove to be critical for TWU to weather and thrive in the COVID-19 storm. 
    - In addition to the provision of new leadership, in January of 2020, we opened the renovated TWU Lansdowne facility in Richmond to students, faculty and staff. The configuration of this facility has enabled TWU Richmond to provide limited face to face Leadership Learning Labs to students through the pandemic that would not have been possible at TWU Minoru.
    - GLOBAL currently serves over 1300 students of which 32% are domestic students and 68% are international. TWU GLOBAL hosts over 360 courses per year – almost 20% of all the courses offered by TWU. In order to better serve students, GLOBAL introduced several process innovations in 2020:
        - 1.	A virtual ticketing system for service and support to students 24/7. This was well received by international students--especially those who are overseas;
        - 2.	First University in Canada to implement __ApplyProof__ verification for international recruitment;
        - 3.	Integration of in-house foreign credential verification system in order to streamline international admissions and reduce time from __4 weeks processing to less than 1 week__.
    - In order to stimulate worldwide interest TWU GLOBAL and MarCom collaborated in a significant effort to increase our worldwide presence. The 2020 Study International campaign included online ads and four articles written to provide confirmatory With an initial stretch goal to reach 2,000,000 readers, the Study International Campaign yielded 3, 971,507 ad impressions, 18,261 social media posts, 1,120,553 reads of the on TWU ads and 21,422 click throughs on the TWU ads.  Malaysia, Philippines, India, China and Nepal were among the top five countries where our readers are coming from and clicking through to find out more about TWU or apply for programs. The campaign accurately captured the students’ attention from these markets.
    - Collaborating with the Marcomm team, TWU GLOBAL ran a marketing campaign for the __RedBridge Initiative__ in April and May where we offered three main incentives for students to apply to TWU’s programs for FALL 2020: “Save Money” (application fee waiver), “Save Time” (Guaranteed application processing time) and “Document Assurances” (working with __ApplyProof__ to produce digital verification system for Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council). The marketing campaign received a wide audience through the Chinese social media such as the Weibo; we counted a total number of 175,000 unique visitors to this campaign throughout China.  This is the highest level of social media engagement in the history of TWU.
    - TWU GLOBAL participated in three EduCanada virtual fairs on May 14th, May 21st and June 3rd for Latin America, Central Asia/Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. A total number of 992 visitors were recorded at the TWU booth; we logged 81 student total leads which we later passed onto the Enrolment Management team for further follow-up. In May and in June, TWU GLOBAL also participated a series of Indian virtual fairs, we virtually went to New Delhi, Chandigarh, Vadodara, Ludhiana and Bangalore in India. A total of 55 students came to our “breakout” room and received training from us. We also trained over 50 Chinese agents (locally in Vancouver and in China) during May to August using weChat, Zoom and weMeet.
    - A highlight for TWU International recruitment was the 96-hour Marathon initiative. We ran three 96-hour Marathon events in May, June and August, and achieved great results during these events. We not only met and trained our partners from different countries, and also received a total number of 460 applications; of these applications, 227 applications where bound for TWU’s graduate programs. These events were critical to bring the success to us for the FA 2020 intake.  Excluding GLOBAL programs such as the IDC (199 students), U1 (31 students) and the MA leadership (30 students) program, TWU GLOBAL recruited over **122 **Pre-enrolled students for Non-Global programs such as the BBA, HKIN, SAMC, Computer Science, Biology programs and the MBA program.
    - TWU Richmond is now at capacity in Lansdowne and is at about 80% of capacity in Minoru. We expect to be at or above capacity at TWU Richmond once the restrictions of COVID-19 are lifted. A key focus of GLOBAL in 2020 has been the expansion and integration of Student Life and the emergence of the TWU Richmond Learning Commons. The Student Life team has seen increased connections via online student clubs and has successfully run new student orientations completely online with a higher percentage of attendance than the traditional orientations, allowing students overseas and local, registered in both Langley and Richmond cohorts, to participate together. **We now have our very first Richmond Christian student-led club.**
    - COVID-19 has spawned increased collaboration; being geographically distanced is no longer a factor in the creation of working teams, connecting TWU-R staff/faculty to others within GLOBAL, and within the campus community as a whole. The result has been new systems (i.e. online registration and GLOBAL ticketing system), information sharing (via University task forces and other working groups), and inter-departmental relationships. New innovations, particularly the Leadership Learning Labs, have also been a highlight that we believe will strengthen the academic quality and marketability of the BA Leadership program moving forward.
    - 
- PUBLIC RELATIONS
    - In April, Winnie Lui assumed the role of Director of Public Relations. s new role. Ms. Lui is covering Media Relations, assisting MarComm with internal communications, and is co-ordinating Crisis Communications with the help of Peter Fassbender and an external agency, PACE Group. Winnie Lui has worked to publicize the exemplary work of TWU students, faculty, staff and alumni and to demonstrate how TWU serves the public good. From mid-July to end of September (roughly 10 weeks), there have been a total of 14 news articles in 2.5 months (by comparison, there were 8 local news articles in total in 2019, half of which were hiring announcements.) TWU’s website news section has been kept current with about 5 new postings per week.
    - 
- STUDENT LIFE
    - The priority for Student Life leading into Fall 2020 was supporting the TWU Access strategy.  Student Life staff helped chair the Virtual Campus Task Force and Regional Hub Task Force. The Virtual Campus Task Force worked with groups across campus to enhance the student experience in a multi-access format, ease online navigation, and centralize communication for all Trinity Western students. The Regional Hub Task Force piloted Access Chapters and Networks and identified alternative physical locations as “pop-up collegiums” where students can study, connect, and plan local events wherever they are learning from this Fall.
    - Richmond Student Life (Kim Chen) organized programming around academic learning labs and managed to sign-up 300+ students to 11 student clubs during orientation week, a YoY growth of 35%. A major focus this year will continue to be growth in evangelism and discipleship initiatives.
    - 
- **Institutional Program
Prioritization**
- On Monday, August 17, 2020, I submitted a report to the
Finance Committee of the Board of Governors called “On Recommendations to the Finance Committee of the
Board of Governors: Budget Recommendations in Response to the Challenges of
COVID-19.” The report included a series of strategic recommendations in
response to the June 2020 directive to take all necessary measures to ensure
that the University would conclude its 2020-2021 fiscal year without
experiencing a negative net operating cash flow.
- Consultations
with key University leaders throughout June and July 2020—including the Staff
Association Executive (SAE), the Faculty Association Executive (FAX), Deans
Council, and the University Leadership Council—signaled a vital consensus:
- Trinity Western University should embark upon a
university-wide assessment of cost-efficiencies. In the short-run, identifying
inefficiencies will be necessary to help TWU navigate an uncertain financial
climate. At the same time, our future rests upon strategic innovation and
change. To this end, we will also need to identify, develop, and launch
innovative programs of strategic, missional, and financial value.
- The
Report documents scenario planning, steps taken to engage the broader
University community, issues related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
positive collaboration by key leaders engaged in a “team of teams” response,
and seven recommendations. Here is the final recommendation in President
Husbands’ August 17, 2020 report:
- Implement University-wide efficiency
initiatives, and develop and launch innovative programs of strategic,
missional, and financial Value. Demonstrate a University-wide commitment to
program prioritization to secure resources to develop, launch, and deliver
innovative programs of strategic, missional, and financial value.
- This
recommendation includes two key elements:
- **Part I.**
- 
Identify and support key individuals capable of carrying out a university-wide
program and organizational prioritization process to submit recommendations for
re-structuring both operations and academic programs to the President and Board
of Governors; and
- **Part II.**
- 
Identify and support key individuals capable of identifying innovative programs
and systems that have the greatest potential to generate significant financial
and strategic value for the University consistent with its mission as a premier
Christian global liberal arts and graduate University.
- In response
to the commitment to identify and support key individual(s) who will be successful
in identifying innovative programs and systems that have the greatest potential
to generate significant financial and strategic value for the University
consistent with its mission as a premier Christian global liberal arts and
graduate University, I have appointed Dr. Phil Laird, Chief Innovation Officer
and have invited Phil to serve on the Executive Leadership Team. Dr. Laird will
take on this new role while retaining his current responsibilities as Vice
Provost of Global
- Given the
complexity, sensitivity, strategic value, and time-sensitive nature of
fulfilling “Part I” of the recommendation, I have directed Provost Bob Wood,
and Senior Vice President of Business Administration and Chief Financial
Officer Aklilu Mulat, to chair a committee of leaders from across the University
to undertake a comprehensive university-wide program and organizational
prioritization analysis and submit recommendations to me by Spring 2021.
- The mandate
given to Provost Wood and S.V.P. Aklilu Mulat takes the following expression:
- **Mandate**
- Provost
Wood and S.V.P. Aklilu Mulat are charged with forming an Institutional Program
Prioritization Task Force (IPPTF) to undertake a comprehensive and systematic
university-wide program and organizational prioritization process based on
quantitative and qualitative information. The analysis must be based upon a
broad and transparent set of categories (such as quality, productivity, market
demand, contribution margin, missional alignment, etc.). It is expected that
the IPPTF will communicate the following on an internal Sharepoint site:
- (1) the evaluative criteria and weighting of
categories to be employed in the analysis;
- (2) specific goals for effective data gathering
and progress;
- (3) update the TWU community on the general
progress of their work;
- (4) post a provisional summary of conclusions
with an invitation to offer response;
- (5) post an executive summary of the final
report submitted to President Husbands.
- Following
an initial period of consultations on the criteria, methodology, and request
for the submission of various pieces of data, the analytical work of the IPPTF
is to be undertaken in confidence. The results of the analysis will be shared
with the University for response and comment before the submission of a final
report and recommendations to President Husbands by the close of the 2020-2021
academic year.
- **The Goal**
- The IPPTF
is to engage in a process of rigorous program analysis of the quality,
productivity, relevance, contribution margin, and opportunity of each academic
program and operational unit so that we can more accurately understand and
assess the financial cost of carrying out our mission. IPPTF recommendations to
the President may result in the elimination or reduction of certain programs or
organizational units. Any reduction in programs and/or services, however, would
be a consequence rather than the goal of the IPPTF process.
- The
principle objective of the IPPTF process is to generate accurate information so
that we can, in turn, develop a financial model that will strengthen the
University’s ability to deliver academic and co-curricular programs of
excellence consistent with our stated promise to “unite reason and faith
through teaching and scholarship” (cf. Senate approved [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/news-events/news/student-learning-outcomes-describe-value-trinity-western-education)), in the service of developing
students with “thoroughly Christian minds” capable of “learning to think with
accuracy, depth, creativity and humility from a thoroughly biblical
perspective” (cf. [“Striving for Excellence in
University Education” Core Value [5](<5.md>)](https://www.twu.ca/about/core-values/striving-excellence-university-education)).
