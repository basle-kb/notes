- ^^Nine Key Questions:^^
    - What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
    - How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
    - What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    - Who cares? 
    - If you are successful, what difference will it make?
    - What are the risks?
    - How much will it cost?
    - How long will it take?
    - What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
- Seek to answer all nine question in **one single story**.
