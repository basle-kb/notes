        - Dear Dr. Husbands;
        - I am writing further to my email earlier today regarding support of a Rhodes Scholarship application by Jordan Koslowsky (a Trinity Western University 2019 graduate). As previously set out, it is my opinion, based on a considerable amount of personal interaction with this student, that he is an excellent representative of all it means to have a Trinity Western University education. He was not only a top-notch student, he was a member of the elite men's Spartan volleyball team. He was a student leader, as well as envisioning and implementing a means to enable refugee families to come to Canada. He is truly a leader who I have no doubt will leave a significant mark on our world.

        - I have copied Jordan on this email so as to enable him to contact you directly. I trust that meets with your approval.
        - In His Service,
            - Bob

    - Note from Jordan:
        - Hello Bob and Dr. Husbands,
        - I hope you both have had a good week. Bob, thank you for sending this introductory email and for your kind words. Your support has been an incredible encouragement to me over the last five years.
        - Dr. Husbands, as Bob mentioned I am in the process of applying for the [Rhodes Scholarship](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/): an international postgraduate award that provides fully-funded scholarships to the University of Oxford. Each year, only one student from BC is selected as a Rhodes Scholar. To my knowledge, no TWU graduate has ever received this award.
        - In order to submit an application, an endorsement is required from the university president. Would you be willing to support me in this way?
        - The application guidelines do not specify exactly what the endorsement needs to include, but I have attached the general 'Referee Guide.' This document provides details about the scholarship and guidelines for the six other referees that are supporting my application. Your endorsement would not need to be as detailed as these reference letters but would ideally include similar elements, if possible. It is also permitted for the current university president to append a letter of recommendation from a former president to their endorsement. I would encourage this addition as Bob witnessed a majority of my TWU journey, including my time on the volleyball team and leadership of the Trinity Refugee Awareness Campaign (TRAC).
        - In order to help you make your decision, I have attached my CV and Official Transcript. It is also important to note that the endorsement would need to be submitted by **23:59 PDT, 10 October 2020.**
        - Finally, if it would be helpful for you, I would be happy to arrange a Zoom call where we can discuss this in more detail.
        - Thank you for your consideration,
        - Jordan Koslowsky
