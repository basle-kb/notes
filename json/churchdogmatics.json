Without a TWU Strategic Plan, it is difficult to build out the university and prioritize spending. COVID-19 will undoubtedly have a multi-year impact on TWU finances, hence the need to engage in a multi-year financial analysis in Fall 2020. The modest drop in enrolment projected for the 2020/21 academic year will have an impact for 2-4 years after as the newly enrolled students work their way through to graduation. CEWS funding will be a significant financial help to TWU for the 2020-21 academic year and give us the needed time to conduct a strategic re-structuring process to put us in a strong financial position for the years to follow.",

When the University Leadership Committee (ULC) met on April 2nd Aklilu Mulat (CFO) provided financial analysis and projections based on what we knew then. This subsequently led to cost-saving measures such as temporary/permanent layoffs, budget constraints, travel restrictions, voluntary compensation\nreductions, hiring and compensation freeze for 2020/21. Since April 2nd Dr. Husbands has asked ULC to consider and develop recommendations on how the University might best save money or increase revenue to navigate through the current financial uncertainty. This was emphasized again on June 5th during a meeting with ULC and other University leaders whereby Dr. Husbands outlined his commitment to seeking counsel on an offensive strategy for fiscal responsibility in advance of a potential crisis.",

In the midst of the city is a crystal river, and on each side of the river is the Tree of Life, bearing fruit and leaves which heal the nations of all their wounds and the effects of the divine covenant curse. This city is the Garden of Eden, remade. The City is the fulfilment of the purposes of the Eden of God. We began in a garden but will end in a city; God\u2019s purpose for humanity is urban! Why?

The ultimate goal set before humanity at the very beginning was that humanculture should take city-form... there should be an urban structuring of human historical existence... The cultural mandate given at creation was a mandate to build the city. Now, after the fall, the city is still a benefit, serving humankind as refuge from the howling wilderness condition into which the fallen human race, exiled from paradise, has been driven... The common grace city has remedial benefits even in a fallen world. It becomes the drawing together of resources, strength and talent no longer just for mutual complementation in the task of developing the resources of the created world, but now a pooling of power for defence against attack, and as an administrative community of welfare for the relief of those destitute by reason of the cursing of the ground\u2019 (Meredith G. Kline, \u2018Kingdom Prologue\u2019). It is widely understood that when God tells Adam and Eve to \u2018have dominion\u2019 and \u2018fill the earth\u2019 he is directing them to build a God-honouring civilisation. They are to bring forth the riches that God put into creation by developing science, art, architecture, human society. Kline reveals, however, that since Revelation reveals that the \u2018end\u2019 of creation (the climax of the work of the \u2018Second Adam\u2019 Jesus Christ) is a city - that therefore God was calling Adam and Eve to be city builders. City building is an ordinance of God just like work and marriage. And indeed, cities draw together human talent and resources and tap the human potential for cultural development as nothing else does.",

            "string": "There is no absolute way to define a \u2018city\u2019. A human settlement becomes more \u2018urban\u2019 as it becomes more a) dense and b) diverse in its population. God made the city to be a developmental tool, a form of cultural \u2018gardening\u2019, designed to draw out the riches he put into the earth, nature and the human soul at creation. Even after the fall, cities are places of \u2018common grace\u2019 though each factor also now can be used (and is!) for evil purposes. C. HOW IT DOES IT 1. First, the city (as the Garden) is a place of refuge and safety. It has always been a place where people come who are too weak to live in other places. In the earliest days, cities provided refuge from wild animals and marauding tribes and criminals. When Israel moved into the promised land, the first cities were built by God\u2019s direction as \u2018cities of refuge\u2019, where the accused person could flee for safety and civil justice. Thus God invented cities to be a sign of divine, not self, protection. Even today, people like the homeless, or new immigrants, or the poor, or people with \u2018deviant\u2019 lifestyles, must live in the city. The city is always a more merciful place for minorities of all kinds. Why? The density of the city creates the possibility of strong minority communities. Density creates diversity. The dominant majorities often dislike cities, but the weak and powerless need them. They cannot survive in the suburbs and small towns. Cain built his cities for selfprotection from God and the vengeance of others. So the refuge of the city can be misused, as when people with sinful lifestyles find refuge in the city from the disapproval of the broader culture. Practical note: It is hard for middle-class families to live in the cities, and thus the cities are seen as hostile places. But for anyone who is not part of the dominant culture (singles, the poor, ethnic minorities, etc.) the city has great advantages over non-urban areas. 2. Second, the city as a cultural mining/development centre. Even the description of the wicked city of Babylon shows the power of the city to draw out the resources of creation - of the physical world and the human soul. In Revelation 18 we see that the city is a place of 1) music and the arts (v.22a), 2) crafts and works of all arts and manufacturing (v.22b), 3) trade and retailing (v.23c), 4) technological advance (v.23a), 5) family building (v.23b). This is what the city was designed by God to do, as an instrument of glorifying him by \u2018mining\u2019 the riches of creation and building a God-honouring civilisation. Practical note: The city, then, has a powerful magnifying glass effect. Since God invented it as a \u2018cultural mine\u2019, it brings out whatever is in the human heart. Why? The density and therefore diversity of the city brings out the best (and the worst - see below) in the human heart. How does it do so? The divinelygiven ability of the city to do \u2018culture-making\u2019 can be discerned at the most practical level by the urban resident. * The city puts me together with unique numbers of people unlike me. * The city attracts the minorities of any society who can band together for mutual support. Thus the city is deeply merciful to those with less power, creating safe enclaves for singles vs. families, the poor (and even the rich!) vs. the bourgeois, immigrants vs. longerterm residents, racial minorities vs. majorities. Thus the city will always be the most diverse human-life structure. * Because I am put together (by its density) with unique numbers of diverse people, all my thinking and views are radically challenged. I am confronted with creative new ways to think about things, and I must abandon my traditional ways or become far more knowledgeable and committed to them than I was before. Thus I become vastly more creative, committed, skilful in all I am or do. * Sin takes this divine-strength - the diversity of the city - and turns it into a place of conflict and strife. The gospel is needed to resist the dark side of this gift. * The city puts me together with unique numbers of people like me. * The city also attracts the strongest as well as the weakest (see above). The challenge of the city attracts the most talented, ambitious (and restless, see below). Thus, whoever you are, when you come to the city you are confronted by far more people who are far better than you at whatever you do. * Because I am put together with unique numbers of like-but-extremely-skilled people in my field, I am radically challenged to \u2018reach down deep\u2019 and do my very best. More than that, I feel driven and pressed by the intensity of the density to realise every ounce of my potential. ",

Cities draw and gather together human resources and tap their potential for cultural development as no other human-life organisation structure can. It is quite wrong to see the city as intrinsically evil! It was designed by God to \u2018draw out\u2019 and to \u2018mine\u2019 what God made. We should appreciate the power of the city and realise that the tremendous evil has been brought to it by us! 3. Third, the city as the place to meet God. Ancient cities were religious institutions. They were usually built around a \u2018ziggurat\u2019 - the original skyscrapers! They were temples where a particular god was thought to \u2018come down\u2019. The cities were seen to be the royal residences of the god, and the city was dedicated to him/her. The city was where the cultus for that god was centred, and where you went if you wanted to serve him or her. All of this was probably a twisted \u2018memory trace\u2019 of the original design of God, that the Edenic city, the new Jerusalem, would be the place where people would meet him, where his temple/ presence would be. After Eden was lost to us (temporarily) through sin, God creates a new city in the desert, by dwelling among his people in the tabernacle, and around his Tent is a city of tents. The city of God will be his dwelling place. Later, the earthly city of Jerusalem becomes a symbol and sign to the future city of God. In the earthly Jerusalem, God\u2019s dwelling place, the temple, stands as the central integrating point of the city\u2019s architecture and as apex of its art and science and technology. As a result, Jerusalem is \u2018the joy of the whole earth\u2019 (Psalm 48.2). But she is only a sign of the city of God which is heavenly and which is to come. All true believers even now have as their mother, \u2018the Jerusalem that is above, is free\u2019 (Galatians 4.26). Why are cities always \u2018religious hotbeds\u2019 where people are spiritually seeking and restless? The density and diversity of the city - the same dynamics that produce cultural development - also keep people spiritually \u2018off balance\u2019 and restless. Cities, therefore, are the key to evangelism in any area. Paul\u2019s missionary journeys essentially ignored the countryside. When he entered a new region, he planted churches in the biggest city, and then left! * Why? The reason for ministry in cities mirrors what we\u2019ve seen about the nature of cities. * Cultural cruciality. In the village, you might win the one or two lawyers to Christ, but if you wanted to win the legal profession, you need to go to the city where you have the law schools, the law journals published, etc. * Global cruciality. In the village, you can win only the single people group that is there, but if you want to spread the gospel into 10-20 new national groups and languages at once, you go to the city where they can all be reached through the lingua franca of the place. * Personal cruciality. In the village little changes and people live in very stable environments. Thus they are suspicious of any major change. Because of the diversity and intensity of the cities, urbanites are much more open to radically new ideas - like the gospel! Because they are surrounded by so many people like and unlike themselves (see above), and so much more mobile and subject to change, urbanites are far more open to change/conversion than any other kind of resident. They may have moved to the city out of a searching restlessness. But even if not, once they get to the city, the pressure and diversity makes even the most traditional and hostile people open to the gospel. * Result? By year 300 AD, 50% of the urban populations of the Roman empire were Christian, while over 90% of the countryside was still pagan. (Note: Some believe that the very word \u2018pagan\u2019 comes from the Greek paganus meaning a farmer or man of the country.) Because Christianity captured the cities, it eventually captured the society, as must always be the case. What captivates the cities also captivates the arts, media, scholarship and the professions. Cities are the \u2018culture-forming wombs\u2019 of the society, made by God to be so. ",

Also the city becomes a refuge, not from the wilderness or persecution, but from God and his law. For example, people have gone to the cities to engage in sexual practices that are proscribed by many places in society, but the natural \u2018tolerance of diversity\u2019 that cities inherently have is twisted into a place where 'anything goes'. People go to the city to create their own moralities. Second, while cities still do attract and sustain enormous race and cultural diversity, human sin makes cities places of constant racial strife, class warfare, crime and violence. This can be seen perfectly in Genesis 11 and Babel. The Babel-builders specifically sought to build a city that would gather people for their own glory (see below). (Many scholars believe that, since Genesis 9 and 10 indicates God wanted human spread and cultural differentiation, Babel may have actually been built in resistance to cultural diversity. See Vos.) In any case, the result of the sin of Babel is confusion. People cannot communicate. Any human effort at unity based on common defiance of God resulted in fragmentation and greater disunity. So today, cities built on human defiance of God and for 'making a name' for the human builders find enormous strife and confusion and violence between diverse groups of people. Practical note: Many people hate cities because of the diversity of cultures, people 'not like us', but we see that God enjoys and wills the diversity of cultures as bringing forth the richness of his creation. Christians should rejoice and enjoy diversity of cultures, recognising that they all stand judged by God's Word.",

'Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth' (Genesis 11.4). The first skyscraper is built in clear defiance of God. The original mandate of God to humankind was to be 'miners' of all the riches of creation. They were to turn to the natural resources of the physical universe and the personal resources of their own creation in the image of God. They were thus to be culture builders, developing science and art and civic life, building civilisation that glorified God as its source and ground. Now we have a city dedicated to 'mining cultural riches' for human glorification and to show its independence of God. Since the human heart is made in the image of God and is totally depraved, therefore the city brings out the very, very best and worst of human capabilities. Adam would have developed a city of God and all the potentialities of creation (physical nature and human spirit) would have been untainted and thus the city would be glorious. Today, however, art and science and technology and education serve to both bring out the best and worst. We can all feel it. Nothing challenges and presses you to excellence like the city. But nothing drives you to reach down deep and do well. In sin that all becomes tainted and idolatrous and exhausting, of course. The purpose of the City of Rebellion is 'to make a name for ourselves'. This is still a deep drive and engine in the building of any human city. It is a spirituality of darkness of enormous force, it is a motivation moving many or most people who move toward the city.",

This will shock you out of your moralism and force you to either finally believe the gospel of sheer grace, or give it up altogether.

HOW TO LIVE IN THE CITY A. MODELS OF LIFE IN THE CITY In every earthly city, there are two 'kingdoms' present, two 'cities' vying for control. They are the City of Baal (or Satan or the god of this world) and the City of God. * The city of Satan deifies power and wealth and human culture itself (making art, technology, business an end in itself instead of a way of glorifying God). * The city of God is marked by God shalom (Jerushalom) - his peace. His peace is a place where stewardship of God, creation, justice, compassion and righteousness lead to harmony and family building and cultural development under God. * Christians are to see the earthly city as something to love and win. They are to win it by seeking its shalom (Jeremiah 29) and seeking to spread the city of God within it, and to battle the city of Satan within it. * We are to see that, though the fight between these two kingdoms happens everywhere in the world, earthly cities are the flashpoints on the battlelines, the places where the fighting is most intense, where the war can be won. Models of urban ministry are then: \u2022 We despise the city. Church as fortress. (Forgetting the city as Jerusalem). \u2022 We are the city. Church as mirror. (Forgetting the city as Babylon). \u2022 We use the city. Church as space capsule. (Forgetting the city as battleground). \u2022 We love the city. Church as leaven. Jeremiah 29. Any theological model of the city will fail if one or more of these three biblical themes of the city is neglected, omitted, or over-emphasised. B. BASIC METHODS/MINISTRIES WORD (Ezra). Ezra recovered the Word for the people. Preaching, discipling, teaching. evangelising in a way contextualised to the concerns and capacities of the people of the city. DEED (Nehemiah). Nehemiah made the city safe and functional. Mercy and Justice! Holistic ministry. Safe streets, good jobs, decent housing, good schools. WORK (Esther). Esther rose high in a pagan society but then used her position at great risk to work for justice in society and for her people. A key part of city ministry is to equip Christians to work distinctively as Christians in their vocation. COMMUNITY (Jeremiah). Jeremiah's letter (chapter 29) told the exiles to neither assimilate nor separate but live out their lives as a community 'seeking the peace of the city'. So we are not only to be 'witnesses' by our individual lives, but by the beauty of our communal life. a) Generosity with money and simplicity of life, b) races and classes loving together over barriers, c) sexual purity and respect shown by men/women to one another in relationships. C. GETTING THE POWER Jesus went down to the city, and was crucified 'outside the gate': sent into howling wilderness, the biblical metaphor for forsakenness - losing the city! Jesus lost the city that was, so we can be citizens of the city to come, making us salt and light in the city that is! Our citizenship in the City-to-come, by his grace, equips us for the city that is. Tim Keller is pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York.",

        "string": "Being one of the bloggers with Cape Town 2010 Blogger Network, I wanted to offer some feedback to Tim Keller's recent paper, [\"What is God's Global Urban Mission,\"](http://conversation.lausanne.org/conversations/detail/10282#article_page_1) posted at [Lausanne.org](http://Lausanne.org), as an advance paper for Cape Town 2010. I have been very thankful for Keller and his commitment to solid biblical teaching, urban environments, and church planting. I heard him speak in Atlanta a few years ago to a group of missionaries; and he did a wonderful job challenging us in our endeavors. There is very little in Keller's excellent paper that I disagree with. He says many of the things he has been saying and writing about for years. While I do not wish to summarize the paper here, I'll try to add some commentary to some of the points that struck my attention on my initial read. I want to encourage you to read the paper, before reading the rest of my post. [GET PAPER HERE](http://conversation.lausanne.org/conversations/detail/10282#article_page_1). First, Keller does an excellent job reminding us of the fact that, as followers of Jesus, we are to live as salt and light in the world not only by calling people to repentance and faith, but also by improving our cities. While he makes the argument to work for the prosperity of the city from Jeremiah's words to Israel, he puts a new twist on it, one that I've not heard articulated by others. After referencing Jeremiah, Keller jumps to 1 Peter and his letter to dispersed believers. By juxtaposing these Old Testament and New Testament passages, Keller makes a stronger argument for why the Church should seek the welfare of the city. For example, he writes: __\"The values of an earthly city contrast sharply with those of the city of God, yet citizens of the city of God must be the very best citizens of their earthly cities. God calls the Jewish exiles to serve the common good of the pagan city. He also has a very practical goal: serving the good of the pagan city is the best possible way for the people of God to thrive and flourish\u2014'if it prospers, you too will prosper' (Jer. 29:7). God is still concerned with his plan of salvation, the establishment of his people\u2014and that is exactly what happened. Because the Jews moved in and sought the peace of the great pagan city, they accumulated the influence and leverage needed to eventually return and restore their homeland.__ Continuing on, he directs our attention to Peter's words: __\"Is there any reason to believe that the model for Israel in Babylon should serve as the model for the church? Yes. In exile, Israel no longer existed in the form of a nation-state with its own government and laws. Instead it existed as an international community and counterculture within other nations. This is also now the form of the church, as Peter and James acknowledge when addressing believers as 'the dispersion' (James 1:1) and 'exiles' (1 Peter 1:1). Twice Peter uses __parapidemois__ as a word for exiles\u2014'resident aliens'\u2014people who live in a country neither as natives nor as tourists passing through. Peter calls Christians to live in the midst of pagan society in such a way that others see their 'good deeds and glorify God' but warns them to expect persecution, nonetheless (1 Peter 2:11\u201312). The echoes of Jeremiah 29 are evident. Like the Jewish exiles, Christian exiles are to engage in their cities, serving the common good rather than conquering or ignoring them. They should expect that the society around them will be both hostile and attracted by believers' lives and service in the city. Peter indicates that believers' good deeds will lead at least some pagans to glorify God.\"__ While some writers cite Jeremiah and then tell the Church to do likewise, Keller's use of the New Testament lends more credibility to this model being for the Church today. Another good point is where he writes, __\"If the gospel is unfolded at the urban center, you reach the region and the society.\" __While this statement does not offer us any new information, it is, once again, a great reminder of the strategic significance of the cities for global evangelization. If more of us truly believed the potential in this reality, we would see radically different missionary paradigms being used today. In light of this strategic significance, Keller makes another good point: __\"The coming world order will be a global, multicultural, urban order. World cities are increasingly crucial in setting the course of culture and life as a whole, even in areas of the world, such as Europe and North America, where cites are not literally growing in size.\"__ While we have known this fact for some time, I would dare ask, \"How many of us are leading our churches, seminaries, colleges, mission agencies, etc. with this reality guiding our strategies?\" My guess is that very few of us are doing so. Therefore, until we begin to respond to the contemporary realities, I hope that Keller continues to be redundant with these matters. One comment I would add here is that Keller did not mention that most of the largest cities in the world (and fastest growing-a point he did allude to) are outside of the traditionally western countries. While cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Sydney, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver (and a host of others) will remain influential for many years to come (and strategic for missions), we in the West must recognize that the day of size is over for western cities when making global comparisons. When discussing why cities are significant to world missions, Keller writes: __\"There is a second reason that world cities are so important to the Christian mission. The millions of newcomers in burgeoning cities have characteristics that make them far more open to the Christian faith than they were before arriving.\"__ Now, while this matter is true regarding receptivity (and a matter on which the Church should strategize accordingly), the opposite is also true: Some people who were nominal in their faith traditions in their homelands, become more devout to those traditions when they migrate to a new land. Finally, I greatly appreciate Keller's comments on the need to do a better job equipping Kingdom Citizens for life in the secular world. He makes a great point here: __\"Second, traditional evangelical ministries tend to give believers relatively little help in understanding how they can maintain their Christian practice outside the walls of the church while still participating in the world of the arts and theatre, business and finance, scholarship and learning, and government and public policy.\"__ The Church must move away from the unbiblical sacred/secular dichotomy that has engulfed us for centuries. We are long past the time when we should have been teaching our children and youth that they need to consider prayerfully obtaining marketable degrees and skills that they can use for global mission. And yes\u2026we should even be telling the same story to those who feel called to an Ephesians 4:11-12-type of ministry. Thankfully, a few seminaries (unfortunately, only a few), in the States, have developed some creative endeavors for their students to receive solid theological education AND simultaneously a marketable degree that would place such ministerial students in very strategic places in the cities of the world. I commend this paper to you for your reading, pondering, discussing, and applying its truths. I know it will bring some great discussion in Cape Town. Keep up the great work, Tim! Thank you, for beating the urban drum!",

                    "string": "As we surveyed the Old Testament material on the city, one of the primary motifs that emerged was that of refuge. Known for fortified walls and well-functioning legal systems, cities were the place for marginalized, poor, and even fugitive people to find safety. When Israel was exiled from the presence of God, they lost not only access to the temple, but also the safety of the city of the great King. The removal of sin from the city was the only way that Israel could remain in the refuge-presence of God (Ex. 29:14), and when the sacrificial system was ultimately unable to remove the sin of the people, the people themselves had to be removed from the safety of God\u2019s presence. How, then, can God\u2019s people hope to be restored to the refuge of the city of the great\u00a0King? Hebrews 13 shows us the way. There we are told that in his crucifixion, \u201cJesus .\u00a0.\u00a0. suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood\u201d (v.\u00a012). At the cross Jesus forgoes the refuge of the earthly city, is expelled from God\u2019s presence, and perfectly bears the sins of the people. The result is the establishment of a future city, \u201cthe city that is to come,\u201d in which God\u2019s people will forever enjoy the refuge and comfort of his presence, uninhibited by sin (v.\u00a014). This has immense significance for the way we presently live our lives. Because through faith we live in communion with God and mysteriously experience the refuge of that future city, we are now able to have a realistic perspective on and relationship to our cities. Even as we live deeply connected lives in our present cities, we understand ourselves to be dual citizens who do not ultimately derive acceptance, approval, comfort, and refuge from them (v.\u00a013). To paraphrase Keller, we are citizens of one city, yet full-time residents of another. Our primary allegiance is given to a city from which we derive our most formative beliefs and practices. And yet we live in our cities of residence as full participants. We do not live as natives, tourists, or travelers; we are \u201cresident aliens.\u201d40 Because in Christ we now experience in an already/not-yet manner the benefits of perfect relationship with God in that future city, we can rightly interpret the blessings of the earthly city as a promissory down payment of that city that is to come.41 \u201cBy his grace, Jesus lost the city-that-was, so we could become citizens of the city-to-come, making us salt and light in the city-that-is.\u201d42",

                    "string": "SEEKING THE WELFARE OF THE CITY As Jeremiah 29:7 commands, we are to pray for the city and seek its welfare. We\u2019re told that in seeking the shalom of the city, we will find our welfare. In other words, if the city prospers, then you will prosper also. This Hebrew word shalom (translated here as \u201cwelfare\u201d) means complete well-being, universal flourishing, wholeness, delight, and blessing. It is \u201ca rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights.\u201d4 It is a description of multidimensional wholeness and flourishing that is not just spiritual, but also material, physical, psychological, and economic. This shalom will not come through Christians establishing parallel subcultural institutions, but through a conviction to bring comprehensive renewal to the city by pursuing its common good.5 Many urban folks that we know often think thoughts like: \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to be here because our church always emphasizes that we\u2019re city positive, but I\u2019m getting worn out. There\u2019s so much pollution and noise and stress in the city that I\u2019d like to move to the mountains of New Hampshire or Lake Tahoe. It\u2019s so quiet and beautiful there, maybe I\u2019d be more happy there.\u201d By default, we assume that being outside the city is good and living inside the city is bad. Indeed, \u201cmost Christians read the Bible through rural lenses.\u201d6 But the city is where culture is shaped. The city is where the people live.7 And God loves people! And since cities are full of people, we know that God really loves cities. As Tim Keller states, \u201cBecause the world is on its way to becoming 70 percent urban, we all need a theological vision that is distinctly urban. Even if you don\u2019t go to the city to minister, make no mistake: the city is coming to\u00a0you.\u201d8 Why do cities matter? Cities matter because people matter. At the risk of overstatement, Bill Crispin argues that cities matter because there is a high concentration of people: \u201cThe city is the place where there are more people .\u00a0.\u00a0. [and since] God loves people .\u00a0.\u00a0. [we can be assured that] He loves the city.\u201d9 Culture is established in cities\u2014the places where diverse people are most densely congregated together to live, work, worship, create, learn, and play. Scripture calls us to align our lives and talents with the missional heart of God by contributing to our culture\u2019s common good\u2014by making a serious contribution to our city\u2019s art, business, music, law, literature, education, medicine, finance, etc. We see a perfect picture of this in Jesus Christ who came to earth in the ultimate contextualized way. Jesus did not undercontextualize his incarnation\u2014he did not commute to Jerusalem from heaven\u2014but through his incarnation, Jesus left heaven and took up residence in an earthly city and engaged a fallen humanity in order to redeem\u00a0it.",

Cities are simply places full of neighbors, places with a higher and more diverse concentration of people than found elsewhere. Think of your city as a place teeming with neighbors whom you are called to know, love, and engage with the gospel. What is beautiful and what is broken in your city is a product of the long history of good and evil committed by the inhabitants of the city, good and evil that have meshed together to create the dominant cultural motifs of your\u00a0city. You should contextualize your worldview to your city the same way you would go about contextualizing your faith to an individual neighbor: listen first, speak second. To love your neighbor intelligently and to share your faith credibly, you must first understand your neighbor. You must learn your neighbor\u2019s history, values, fears, dreams, and mode of operation. Once you begin to learn your neighbors, you have information by which you can most effectively love and communicate to them. This rule of relationship also governs our relationship to our cities. Contextualization in the city is essentially the task of getting to know your city\u2019s story in order to find the points at which that narrative overlaps or differs with the gospel. It is obtaining the information you need to most effectively love and communicate to your\u00a0city.",

To cities filled with newcomers and strangers, Christianity offered an immediate basis for attachments.

And to cities faced with epidemics, fires, and earthquakes, Christianity offered effective nursing services.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

Today we\u2019re going to dig into the substance of plans in a little bit more detail, based on examinations of institutional strategic plans at 39 universities (26 of which are in Canada) and 11 colleges and polytechnics in Canada.

He was not only a top-notch student, he was a member of the elite men's Spartan volleyball team. He was a student leader, as well as envisioning and implementing a means to enable refugee families to come to Canada. He is truly a leader who I have no doubt will leave a significant mark on our world.",
